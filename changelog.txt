You don't have to write any HTML, just specify the field(s) you'd like to show and let the block do the rest for you. The block will display the Field Labels and the Field Values in a nice readable format. Display formats available include: ul, ol, dl, p, div, and table. Want to show all but a few fields? Just specify which fields to exclude if that's what you're after :) (@sc0ttkclark)

* Enhancement: You can now specify a custom display separator for repeateable fields to use when rendering. #6892 #6890 (@JoryHogeveen)
* Changed: Resetting a Pod has been removed from the Pods Admin > Edit Pods page, instead of clicking "Delete All Items" there, you can now access this directly from Pods Admin > Settings > Cleanup & Reset as the new "Delete all content for a Pod" option. You can specify the Pod you want to delete content for and it explains exactly what you can expect from running it. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: Updated Pods Admin > Help page now lists more add-ons and where to get them / get support for them. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Properly convert accents when creating a new pod and using the label to generate the pod name. #6874 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Relationship/file fields that are hidden on the screen will now have all field values referenced instead of only the first value when multiple is enabled for that field. #6913 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: `pods_query_arg()` now correctly excludes all `$_GET` parameters when passing a manual URL into the function. (@sc0ttkclark)

* Fixed: Pod/Group/Field configurations being saved now get their checkbox boolean options properly enforced as 0/1 and sent so they are not reverted to the default value on next load. #6485 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Fields added manually through the older `pods_group_add()` function now get their field types properly recognized. #6381 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Field config overrides for requiring a field when outputting via PHP are now properly recognized by DFV JS logic for validation and form submission prevention. #6352 (@sc0ttkclark)

Pods with non-DB sources currently do not have Edit/Duplicate/Reset Content/Delete links. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Feature: The file field can now support any image, video, or audio mime types that are supported by WordPress. #6577 #6578 (@sc0ttkclark, @JoryHogeveen)

* Fixed: Resolve issues with values that are objects and convert them to arrays for relationship value formatting in DFV field renders. #6566 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Show the Add Media button in forms that use the post_content field. #6569 (@sc0ttkclark)
* New minimum WP version required: WordPress 5.7+ (previously: WP 5.5+)
* No minimum PHP version changes (currently: PHP 5.6+) but please be aware that PHP 7.2+ will be required for the Pods 3.0+ feature release. You should take the time to update to PHP 8.0+ because there’s major speed improvements to be had 🙂

= 2.8.23 - July 4th, 2022 =

* Fixed: Resolved revision issues when `revisions_to_keep_limit` is set to 0 in the post type. It was supposed to see 0 and use the default revision limit. Instead, it was disabling the revisions for that post type. #6499 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved potential PHP warnings on certain sites by preparing SQL queries separately from other string processing. #6556 #6555 #6554 (@JoryHogeveen, @sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved potential PHP notices when getting table information in `PodsData::table()`. (@JoryHogeveen)
* Fixed: Resolved potential PHP type conversion warnings by passing `SORT_REGULAR` to `array_unique()`` in the File field saving process. (@JoryHogeveen)
* Fixed: Pods Auto Templates defaults for some fields were set to "true" and that is now treated as empty. The default for those fields are now empty as intended.

* Tweak: When saving pod items, pre-process tableless field type data consistently to better support table-based storage. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: When saving pod items, allow filtering the list of processed data values that will be used to do the final save with `pods_api_save_pod_item_processed_data_to_save`. (@sc0ttkclark)

= 2.8.11 - April 8th, 2022 =

* Added: Now you can limit relationship fields that relate to post types to only include posts that match the current post's author. #4291 (@sc0ttkclark)

* Added: JS API - New JS helper functions to interact with fields on the screen including `window.PodsDFV.getField( pod, itemId, fieldName, formCounter )`, `window.PodsDFV.getFields( pod, itemId, formCounter )`, `window.PodsDFV.getFieldValue( pod, itemId, fieldName, formCounter )`, `window.PodsDFV.setFieldValue( pod, itemId, fieldName, value, formCounter )`. #6471 #6475 (@zrothauser, @sc0ttkclark)
* Added: CLI - New CLI command `wp pods playbook run` which can run playbook .json files which allow you to perform multiple tasks with the Pods API. Useful for coordinating renames of Pods, Groups, and Fields, along with other CLI tasks between different environments. #6460 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Limit by post status option has been resolved but you may need to re-save your post status choices again. #6470 (@sc0ttkclark)

= 2.8.9 - January 31st, 2022 =

* Added: There's a new tool at Pods Admin > Settings > Tools that will let you "Recreate missing tables". This will run the logic used to create those tables needed by Pods. This is currently just for `wp_podsrel` but will eventually include all other table-based Pods too. #5795 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: Are you interested in seeing how much data your Pods are storing? You can now add `&pods_include_row_counts=1` to the Pods Admin > Edit Pods URL and see how many Data Rows, Meta Rows, and Relationship Rows are associated to each pod. This is a hidden feature and will be added in the future as a link directly within the Edit Pods screen. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: Support for alignment and custom classes on Pods Blocks. Disabled support for Anchors until they are officially resolved for dynamic blocks in core. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: Hooks implemented for new compatibility with the Pods Pro by SKCDEV Add On for Advanced Relationship Storage. (@sc0ttkclark)

* Fixed: Resolved issues with 00:00 times when HTML5 inputs are enabled for Date/Time fields. #6256 #6382 (@zrothauser, @sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Some times after updating to 2.8, a Pod may have orphaned fields that exist outside of groups. This normally gets handled during the first time you edit a pod but now we have an additional count check to see if the field counts match as expected when editing a pod so it can trigger that process even after the first edit in 2.8. #6384 #6302 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Cleaned up and abstracted the logic to build the field name used in DB queries for a field. #6270 #6411 (@sc0ttkclark, @jamesgol)

* Fixed: Enforce slug characters on registration of post type / taxonomy instead of the admin config field for Custom Rewrite Slug and Archive Page Slug Override. #6354 (@sc0ttkclark)

**New PHP & WP Minimum Version Requirements:**

* PHP Version Change Requirement 5.3+
* WP Version Change Required 4.5+

**Major Changes in 2.7 Release: Flexible Relationships:**

* New Relationship Field Format "List View": The power of the new flexible relationships is our new modal window that opens within the existing record for relationship fields. This is modeled after the Media Modal from WordPress and provides full functionality to Add New related records or edit existing records all from within the parent record of the relationship. This is provided through our new List View field format for relationship fields. To see a demo of this field in action [head on over to our YouTube](https://youtu.be/V8c067GAEcA)
* Add New with Flexible Relationships: The new flexible relationships will automatically enable Add New on all your existing relationships, but you can disable this from the Additional Options tab for each relationship field. You can switch field formats to the new List View from additional options tab as well.
* Dynamic Field Views: The relationship fields and file upload fields have been rewritten to take advantage of "Dynamic Field Views", driven by JavaScript. More technical details about the directions we went towards these field changes can be read about in our ["Pods 2.7: What We Did and Why We Did It"](https://pods.io/2017/12/05/pods-2-7-developer-notes/)

* Fixed: pods_var bug with strtolower PHP warning when managing content

* Fixed: Pod :: lookup_row_ids now forces (int) on values given, also allows $tbl_row_ids to be array instead of only just comma-separate string as before
* Fixed: Pod :: findRecords now looks in 'select' parameter to find fields that need to be included
* Fixed: Pod :: showform now forces (int) on explicitly values that hit the DB

* Added: pods_var_set function to set variables, operates similar to pods_var, has three variables ($value, $key, $type) and returns $value on success (if $type is an array or object it will return the updated $type, if $type is 'url' it will return the full updated $url)
