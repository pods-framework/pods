Found a bug? Have a great feature idea? Get on GitHub and tell us about it and we'll get right on it: https://pods.io/submit/

Our GitHub has the full list of all prior releases of Pods: https://github.com/pods-framework/pods/releases

= 2.8.9 - January 31st, 2022 =

* Added: There's a new tool at Pods Admin > Settings > Tools that will let you "Recreate missing tables". This will run the logic used to create those tables needed by Pods. This is currently just for `wp_podsrel` but will eventually include all other table-based Pods too. #5795 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: Are you interested in seeing how much data your Pods are storing? You can now add `&pods_include_row_counts=1` to the Pods Admin > Edit Pods URL and see how many Data Rows, Meta Rows, and Relationship Rows are associated to each pod. This is a hidden feature and will be added in the future as a link directly within the Edit Pods screen. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: Support for alignment and custom classes on Pods Blocks. Disabled support for Anchors until they are officially resolved for dynamic blocks in core. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: Hooks implemented for new compatibility with the Pods Pro by SKCDEV Add On for Advanced Relationship Storage. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Abstracted the meta saving into `PodsMeta::save_meta()` so that it can be used to remove duplicate logic in other methods and implemented it for meta fallback for simple relationship compatibility saving in integrations like Paid Membership Pro. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved single/double quotes that were getting converted to HTML entities for Custom Post Type singular/plural labels. #6399 #6394 (@JoryHogeveen)
* Fixed: Additional work on preventing unnecessary queries from other plugins with our Meta API integration. #6379 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Groups now properly check their access rights before showing. #6377 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved deprecation notices where we still called `pods_ui_message()`, replaced with `pods_message()`. #6340 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved issues with 00:00 times when HTML5 inputs are enabled for Date/Time fields. #6256 #6382 (@zrothauser, @sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Some times after updating to 2.8, a Pod may have orphaned fields that exist outside of groups. This normally gets handled during the first time you edit a pod but now we have an additional count check to see if the field counts match as expected when editing a pod so it can trigger that process even after the first edit in 2.8. #6384 #6302 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Cleaned up and abstracted the logic to build the field name used in DB queries for a field. #6270 #6411 (@sc0ttkclark, @jamesgol)
* Fixed: Resolved Date/Time field issues on certain browsers/OS combinations. #6318 #6300 (@sc0ttkclark, @zrothauser)

* Fixed: Resolved PHP warning in PHP 8+ on 404 pages for taxonomy terms. #6383 #6387 (@JoryHogeveen)

* Fixed: Enforce slug characters on registration of post type / taxonomy instead of the admin config field for Custom Rewrite Slug and Archive Page Slug Override. #6354 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolve issues with `PodsAPI::save_field()` when trying to save a field just using the name, now you can pass the `override` parameter as true to bypass duplicate field checks to force saving as matching field. #6345 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: More robust checking for conflicts with extended post types and taxonomies before registering them. #6348 #6342 (@sc0ttkclark)

* Fixed: Set up the currency configurations needed for frontend forms with currency fields (using non-USD currencies) in case they haven't been set up yet. #6315 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Added backwards compatibility for `pods_group_add()` so that when a field is marked as hidden in the UI but it is added directly with `pods_group_add()`, then it will treat it as not hidden anymore. #6309 (@sc0ttkclark)

**New PHP & WP Minimum Version Requirements:**

* PHP Version Change Requirement 5.3+
* WP Version Change Required 4.5+

**Major Changes in 2.7 Release: Flexible Relationships:**

* New Relationship Field Format "List View": The power of the new flexible relationships is our new modal window that opens within the existing record for relationship fields. This is modeled after the Media Modal from WordPress and provides full functionality to Add New related records or edit existing records all from within the parent record of the relationship. This is provided through our new List View field format for relationship fields. To see a demo of this field in action [head on over to our YouTube](https://youtu.be/V8c067GAEcA)
* Add New with Flexible Relationships: The new flexible relationships will automatically enable Add New on all your existing relationships, but you can disable this from the Additional Options tab for each relationship field. You can switch field formats to the new List View from additional options tab as well.
* Dynamic Field Views: The relationship fields and file upload fields have been rewritten to take advantage of "Dynamic Field Views", driven by JavaScript. More technical details about the directions we went towards these field changes can be read about in our ["Pods 2.7: What We Did and Why We Did It"](https://pods.io/2017/12/05/pods-2-7-developer-notes/)
