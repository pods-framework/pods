New minimum required versions have been updated as follows which includes notices to let you know if you need to update something:

* New minimum WP version required: WordPress 6.0+ (previously: WP 5.7+)
* New minimum PHP version required: PHP 7.2+ (previously: PHP 5.6+) — Hey! You should take the time to update to PHP 8.1+ because that is currently the lowest version actively supported by The PHP Group.

* Added: Set up backward compatible updates to our prior `depends-on` and related logic for internal conditional logic prior to Pods 3.0 so they now properly translate over to the new format required. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: When importing and exporting Pods packages, they now include the list of active components. (@sc0ttkclark)

* Fixed: The Pods repair tool was overwriting the storage type for table-based pods to `meta`, now it uses the proper logic there and also uses a new abstracted method `Pod::get_default_storage()` for defaults when empty. The tool now also won't overwrite the table schema for each Pod to prevent unintended problems. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved PHP error when using WordPress versions prior to 6.1 which did not have the `did_filter()` function that was called. (@sc0ttkclark)

You can use repeatable fields with the Pods template tag `[each your_repeatable_field]` to easily loop and display information with `{@_value}` Supported field types include: Plain Text, Website, Phone, Email, Password, Date / Time, Date, Time, oEmbed, Plain Paragraph text, WYSIWYG, Plain Number, Currency, and Color Picker. Supported Pod Types include: Post Types (meta-based), Taxonomies (meta-based), Users (meta-based), and Comments (meta-based). #1095 #6304 (@sc0ttkclark, @zrothauser)
* Feature: Register Pods configurations with JSON/YML files in your theme when stored in `pods.json`, `pods/pods.json`, `pods/templates.json`, etc. Custom paths can be registered to support third party plugins as well. Register new paths using `pods_register_config_path( $full_directory_path )` that contain a `/pods/` directory to automatically pull from or use `pods_register_config_file( $full_file_path, 'json' )` to register a specific file. #4856 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Feature: The initial integration for WPGraphQL has been merged from the WPGraphQL Integration Add-On for Pods Pro by SKCDEV.

Pods with non-DB sources currently do not have Edit/Duplicate/Reset Content/Delete links. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Feature: The file field can now support any image, video, or audio mime types that are supported by WordPress. #6577 #6578 (@sc0ttkclark, @JoryHogeveen)

* Fixed: Handle processing the Pods display tags in a more dynamic way for attributes and passing them down to the tag handlers. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Enable media buttons for the post_content field like they should so that forms outside the admin screen continue to function as expected. #6525 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolve issues with values that are objects and convert them to arrays for relationship value formatting in DFV field renders. #6566 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Show the Add Media button in forms that use the post_content field. #6569 (@sc0ttkclark)
* New minimum WP version required: WordPress 5.7+ (previously: WP 5.5+)
* No minimum PHP version changes (currently: PHP 5.6+) but please be aware that PHP 7.2+ will be required for the Pods 3.0+ feature release. You should take the time to update to PHP 8.0+ because there’s major speed improvements to be had 🙂

= 2.8.23 - July 4th, 2022 =

* Tweak: Added support for exporting post types and taxonomies to PHP for debugging purposes. While logged in as an admin, add `?pods_debug_register_export=1` to expose textareas on the page to get the code. (@sc0ttkclark)

* Fixed: Resolved revision issues when `revisions_to_keep_limit` is set to 0 in the post type. It was supposed to see 0 and use the default revision limit. Instead, it was disabling the revisions for that post type. #6499 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved potential PHP warnings on certain sites by preparing SQL queries separately from other string processing. #6556 #6555 #6554 (@JoryHogeveen, @sc0ttkclark)

* Fixed: Resolved potential PHP type conversion warnings by passing `SORT_REGULAR` to `array_unique()`` in the File field saving process. (@JoryHogeveen)
* Fixed: Pods Auto Templates defaults for some fields were set to "true" and that is now treated as empty. The default for those fields are now empty as intended.

= 2.8.22.1 - July 3rd, 2022 =

* Fixed: Resolve potential PHP errors from Relationship/File field saves by ensuring consistent array structures.

= 2.8.22 - July 3rd, 2022 =

* Tweak: When saving pod items, pre-process tableless field type data consistently to better support table-based storage. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: When saving pod items, allow filtering the list of processed data values that will be used to do the final save with `pods_api_save_pod_item_processed_data_to_save`. (@sc0ttkclark)

* Tweak: Support custom heading tags for the Heading field in the DFV-powered areas like the Edit Pod screen. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: Further lock down custom heading tags in PHP-powered forms so that they can only contain basic tag names. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Avoid setting post terms that are empty when saving pod item. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Dot-traversal in Pods Templating `[if]` conditional shortcodes references the correct pod and expected field path. (@sc0ttkclark)

* Added: New function `Pods::is_defined()` determines whether a Pod was defined or if it was generated adhoc when calling a non-defined Pod. (@sc0ttkclark, @JoryHogeveen)
* Added: New function `Pods::is_valid()` replaces the logic in `Pods::valid()` to better follow the naming pattern used elsewhere in Pods. `Pods::valid()` is not deprecated yet. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: New functions `pods_static_cache_get()`, `pods_static_cache_set()`, and `pods_static_cache_clear()` abstract the static cache handling that would sometimes fail if the class was not available. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: New filter `pods_init_register_assets_load_pods_dfv_on_front` which allows you to force loading Pods DFV scripts on the front of the site when needed. Normally they will be included but some plugins/themes may need them enqueued sooner. (@sc0ttkclark)

= 2.8.15 - April 16th, 2022 =

* Added: New `pods_callback` support in `Pods::find()` so that you can pass a callback function to use for `pods()` usage with relationships using the `output` as "pods". This allows for using shared instances across large data sets to reduce time. (@sc0ttkclark)

* Fixed: When using table-based fields and a non-simple relationship has a field in the table, it will still be expanded like a normal relationship field when requesting it by name with no traversal. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Call `PodsField_Pick::simple_objects()` using the object instead of statically to prevent PHP notices. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Adjust the `Pods\REST\V1\Endpoints\Base::check_permission()` method so that it references the correct `\Pods` object. (@sc0ttkclark)

= 2.8.14 - April 15th, 2022 =

* Added: Now you can limit relationship fields that relate to post types to only include posts that match the current post's author. #4291 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: JS API - Now you can hook into right after the Pods form fields have loaded by using `window.PodsDFV.hooks.addAction( 'pods_init_complete', 'pods/dfv', () => {} );` #6482 (@zrothauser, @sc0ttkclark)
* Added: JS API - New JS helper functions to interact with fields on the screen including `window.PodsDFV.getField( pod, itemId, fieldName, formCounter )`, `window.PodsDFV.getFields( pod, itemId, formCounter )`, `window.PodsDFV.getFieldValue( pod, itemId, fieldName, formCounter )`, `window.PodsDFV.setFieldValue( pod, itemId, fieldName, value, formCounter )`. #6471 #6475 (@zrothauser, @sc0ttkclark)

* Added: Are you interested in seeing how much data your Pods are storing? You can now add `&pods_include_row_counts=1` to the Pods Admin > Edit Pods URL and see how many Data Rows, Meta Rows, and Relationship Rows are associated to each pod. This is a hidden feature and will be added in the future as a link directly within the Edit Pods screen. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: Support for alignment and custom classes on Pods Blocks. Disabled support for Anchors until they are officially resolved for dynamic blocks in core. (@sc0ttkclark)

* Fixed: Resolved issues with 00:00 times when HTML5 inputs are enabled for Date/Time fields. #6256 #6382 (@zrothauser, @sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Some times after updating to 2.8, a Pod may have orphaned fields that exist outside of groups. This normally gets handled during the first time you edit a pod but now we have an additional count check to see if the field counts match as expected when editing a pod so it can trigger that process even after the first edit in 2.8. #6384 #6302 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Cleaned up and abstracted the logic to build the field name used in DB queries for a field. #6270 #6411 (@sc0ttkclark, @jamesgol)

**New PHP & WP Minimum Version Requirements:**

* PHP Version Change Requirement 5.3+
* WP Version Change Required 4.5+

**Major Changes in 2.7 Release: Flexible Relationships:**

* New Relationship Field Format "List View": The power of the new flexible relationships is our new modal window that opens within the existing record for relationship fields. This is modeled after the Media Modal from WordPress and provides full functionality to Add New related records or edit existing records all from within the parent record of the relationship. This is provided through our new List View field format for relationship fields. To see a demo of this field in action [head on over to our YouTube](https://youtu.be/V8c067GAEcA)
* Add New with Flexible Relationships: The new flexible relationships will automatically enable Add New on all your existing relationships, but you can disable this from the Additional Options tab for each relationship field. You can switch field formats to the new List View from additional options tab as well.
* Dynamic Field Views: The relationship fields and file upload fields have been rewritten to take advantage of "Dynamic Field Views", driven by JavaScript. More technical details about the directions we went towards these field changes can be read about in our ["Pods 2.7: What We Did and Why We Did It"](https://pods.io/2017/12/05/pods-2-7-developer-notes/)

* Fixed: Pods Templates were creating erroneous output with nested `[if _fieldname_][else][/if]` and `[each _fieldname_][/each]` template tags inside HTML entities after 2.6.9 upgrade. This fix bypasses `do_shortcode` and also bypasses `do_shortcodes_in_html_tags` which was the problem with this particular fix. Fixes (#4324,#4307,#4307). (#4335). [@pglewis]
* Fixed: Multi-file fields save was causing array to string conversion warning. New function & helper added called `array_filter_walker` for backwards compatibility. Also fixes the 'editable' titles in Multiple File Upload. Fixes (#4112,#4313). (#4314). [@mgratch,@JoryHogeveen,@sc0ttkclark]
* Added: Pods Templates & Page Capabilities have been added to the Members Cap Filter and Pods Role Manager from Components, Roles & Capabilities.

* Fixed: Pods UI 'label_add' wasn't being used on button at top of manage table list
* Fixed: Pagination bug with custom page_var set in Pod object, would add the custom page_var to the URL over and over
* Fixed: Upgrade script updated to include all upgrades prior to 1.6, which had been left out in a previous release
* Fixed: More strict matching in Pod::findRecords for field names, instead of just removing '(' and ')', it now removes 'function_name(' first, so that fields with the same name as function names won't be pulled

* Fixed: pods_var bug with strtolower PHP warning when managing content

* Added: pods_var_set function to set variables, operates similar to pods_var, has three variables ($value, $key, $type) and returns $value on success (if $type is an array or object it will return the updated $type, if $type is 'url' it will return the full updated $url)
