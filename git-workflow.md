#Pods Framework Git Workflow

## Branching

Based on the [Git-flow branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

#### Current 2.x release cycle

*   master

    *   Latest stable
    *   Should be based off of commit that tagged 2.4.3 from the 2.x branch

*   2.x

    *   Development release, features and fixes merged in that work and are tested
    *   This would normally be called ‘develop’, but too many things are based off if it to change it right now

*   feature/1234

    *   Bug fixes, enhancements, features work goes here, and should be constrained to the issue ## specifically, except in circumstances where that may be difficult.
    *   Prerequisite is an issue number and must be named in this format:

            *   _feature/_**_{issue-number}_**

*   hotfix/1235

    *   Hot fix work that must based off of and go directly into master, bypassing existing work going into develop for the next release
    *   Issue number not required, but if in reference to it, the prerequisite is an issue number and must be named in this format:

            *   _hotfix/_**_{issue-number}_**

#### **Current 3.0 development cycle**

&nbsp;

*   _<i>There is no stable branch during 3.0 development work, see next section for 3.x stable branching._</i>
&nbsp;

*   release/3.0

    *   Development release, features and fixes merged in that work and are tested
    *   Should be based off of the current 3.0-unstable branch

*   feature/1234-3.0

    *   Use feature/1234 normally, unless you need to commit to 2.x AND 3.0, in which you would need to make the 3.0 branch as feature/1234-3.0
    *   Bug fixes, enhancements, features work goes here, and should be constrained to the issue ## specifically, except in circumstances where that may be difficult.
    *   Prerequisite is an issue number and must be named in this format:

            *   _feature/3.0/_**_{issue-number}_**

#### **3.0 stable release, branches restructured**

###### **2.x becomes secondary stable**

*   2.x

    *   Latest stable (2.5)
    *   Should be based off of commit that tagged 2.5 from the master branch (**_prior to 3.0 stable_**)
    *   This would probably be release/2.x but due to legacy reasons, changing it would present some challenges for folks

*   develop/2.x

    *   Development release, features and fixes merged in that work and are tested
    *   Should be based off of the current develop branch (**_prior to 3.0 stable_**)

*   feature/1234-2.x

    *   Use feature/1234 normally, unless you need to commit to 2.x AND 3.x, in which you would need to make the 3.0 branch as feature/1234-2.x
    *   Bug fixes, enhancements, features work goes here, and should be constrained to the issue ## specifically, except in circumstances where that may be difficult.
    *   Prerequisite is an issue number and must be named in this format:

            *   _feature/_**_{issue-number}_**

*   hotfix/1235-2.x

    *   Use hotfix/1234 normally, unless you need to commit to 2.x AND 3.x, in which you would need to make the 3.0 branch as hotfix/1234-2.x
    *   Hot fix work that must based off of and go directly into master, bypassing existing work going into develop for the next release
    *   Issue number not required, but if in reference to it, the prerequisite is an issue number and must be named in this format:

            *   _hotfix/_**_{issue-number}_**

###### **3.x becomes new stable**

*   master

    *   Latest stable (3.0)
    *   Should be based off of commit that tagged 3.0 from the release/3.0 branch
    *   See 2.x secondary stable for what to do with existing _master_

*   develop

    *   Development release, features and fixes merged in that work and are tested
    *   Should be based off of the current release/3.0 branch
    *   See 2.x secondary stable for what to do with existing _develop_

*   feature/1234

    *   Bug fixes, enhancements, features work goes here, and should be constrained to the issue ## specifically, except in circumstances where that may be difficult.
    *   Prerequisite is an issue number and must be named in this format:

            *   _feature/_**_{issue-number}_**

*   hotfix/1235

    *   Hot fix work that must based off of and go directly into _master_, bypassing existing work going into _develop_ for the next release
    *   Issue number not required, but if in reference to it, the prerequisite is an issue number and must be named in this format:

            *   _hotfix/_**_{issue-number}_**

#### **1.x EOL**

*   The current 1.x branch should get archived and cease to be supported, when 3.0 becomes stable.
*   Until then, it will continue on as 1.x branch, and follow same structure as 2.x secondary stable above.
*   We don’t anticipate any future 1.x release now or prior to 3.0 stable, but we don’t want to rule it out entirely, especially without notice.

## Creating and Merging a Feature branch

*   $develop = _develop_ Branch to merge into
*   $feature = Branch with feature to merge
*   Instructions:

    1.  **Create **new local $feature branch** from **$develop
    2.  **Push / Publish** $feature branch
    3.  Ensure **Pull Request** is created on GitHub.com

            *   PR to merge $feature into $develop
        *   Set release milestone
        *   Set proper labels

                    *   Patch?

                *   Set assignee (yourself, lead dev, or tester)

        4.  Complete remaining development on $feature (if any)

            *   **Commit / Push** additional changes to $feature as needed

        5.  **Pull** $develop **from remote**
    6.  **Merge** $develop **into** $feature
    7.  **Commit** $feature
    8.  **Push** $feature
    9.  **Test** code again (to ensure $develop or merge has not broken anything)

            *   If broken, follow Steps D through H again

        10.  Verify **Travis-CI** passes on latest push to **Pull Request**

            *   If broken, follow Steps D through H again

        11.  **Merge Pull Request** on GitHub.com
    12.  **Delete** $feature branch

## Creating and Merging a Hotfix branch

*   $master = _master_ Branch to merge into
*   $hotfix = Branch with hotfix to merge
*   $develop = _develop_ Branch to merge into
*   Instructions:

    1.  **Create **new local $hotfix branch** from **$master
    2.  **Push / Publish** $hotfix branch
    3.  Ensure **Pull Request** is created on GitHub.com

            *   PR to merge $hotfix into $master
        *   Set release milestone
        *   Set proper labels

                    *   Patch?

                *   Set assignee (yourself, lead dev, or tester)

        4.  Complete remaining development on $hotfix (if any)

            *   **Commit / Push** additional changes to $hotfix as needed

        5.  **Pull** $master **from remote**
    6.  **Merge** $master **into** $hotfix
    7.  **Commit** $hotfix
    8.  **Push** $hotfix
    9.  **Test** code again (to ensure $master or merge has not broken anything)

            *   If broken, follow Steps D through H again (may want to also foll

        10.  Verify **Travis-CI** passes on latest push to **Pull Request**

            *   If broken, follow Steps D through H again

        11.  **Merge Pull Request** on GitHub.com
    12.  **Merge** $hotfix **into **$develop
    13.  **Commit** $develop
    14.  **Push** $develop
    15.  **Delete** $hotfix branch

## Releasing and tagging a new version

1.  **Merge** _develop_ **into** _master_
2.  **Tag** latest commit in master using the following format:

    *   **_{x}_**_.x/_**_{x.x.x}_**

            *   Where **_{x}_** is the major release version (2.x)
        *   Where **_{x.x.x}_** is the full release version (2.5)

3.  **Push all tags**

## Further notes

Some PHP IDEs and Git applications w/ UI support git-flow natively or through extensions. They will work great with this model, however working alongside the multiple versions (master vs 3.0 current; master vs 2.x in future) will **not** support the built-in master / develop / feature / hotfix / archive / release workflows for the secondary branching we’ve added to suit our needs.
