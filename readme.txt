Pods is a framework for creating, managing, and deploying customized content types and fields for any project.

== Description ==

Manage all your custom content needs in one location with the Pods Framework.

* **Create content types** including Custom Post Types, Custom Taxonomies, and our special Advanced Content Types (ACTs get their own custom tables)
* **Extend and customize content types** including Posts, Pages, Categories, Tags, Users, and Media with one easy click
* **Create custom settings pages** easily within seconds
* **Add custom fields** to *any* content type
* **Group your fields** however you'd like into their own sections and add additional headings to help organize
* **Show your fields** anywhere using our [blocks](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-blocks/), [shortcodes](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-shortcode/), [widgets](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-widgets/), or the non-coder [Pods Template](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-templates/) approach along with our [automatic theme integration](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-templates/auto-templates/)
* **Create connections** between any of your content with [relationship fields](https://docs.pods.io/fields/relationship/) to keep your content organized

Let Pods help you grow your development and site building skills so that you can manage content beyond the standard WordPress Posts & Pages.

Check out our [Documentation](https://docs.pods.io/), [Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/pods/), and our [Live Community Slack Chat](https://support.pods.io/chat/) for assistance building your dream project with Pods.

= Introduction =

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WqKZr2gPZY]

= Content types that evolve with your needs =

Create any type of content that you want -- small or large -- we've got you covered. Every content type created with Pods gets all the love it needs to grow up big and strong. You'll get an easy-to-use interface that lets you manage field groups, custom fields, and how your content type will look or function.

= Create new content types =

With Pods, you can create entirely new content types and settings pages.

= Every Field Type, FREE =

If you choose to use Pods for your custom fields, you'll get every field type you need, free of charge. Pods works great alongside [other custom field plugins](https://comparewp.org/cck) like [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) too.

We have an extensive collection of over [25 different input types to choose from on 20+ different field types for any content structure](https://docs.pods.io/fields/). Each field type comes with their own additional options to help you customize content entry and display.

You can also control visibility by role/capability and [other advanced options](https://docs.pods.io/fields/settings-advanced/).

* **Repeatable Fields:** Turn almost any field into a repeatable field with multiple values
* **Text:** Plain Text, Website, Phone, Email, Password
* **Paragraph:** Plain Paragraph Text, WYSIWYG (Visual Editor), Code (Syntax Highlighting)
* **Date / Time:** Date and Time, Date, Time
* **Number:** Plain Number, Currency (30+ international currencies)
* **Relationships / Media:** File / Image / Video (Media library and basic upload options available), Avatar (for extended Users), oEmbed, Relationship (Dropdown, Multi Select, Autocomplete, Checkboxes, Radio Buttons, and List View available)
* **Checkbox** (Yes / No)
* **Color Picker**

= Relationships to rule the world with =

The power is in your hands with our comprehensive support to **relate your content to anything**.

* **Custom defined lists** of text options
* Relate to any **Post Type or Taxonomy** posts / terms
* Relate to any **User** profile
* Relate to **User Roles or Capabilities**
* Relate to any **Comment**

And many other relationships are also available including:

* **Image Sizes**
* **Navigation Menus**
* Relate to content within **any Database Table**
* **Countries** (predefined)
* **US States** (predefined)
* **Canadian Provinces** (predefined)
* **Calendar - Days of Week** (predefined)
* **Calendar - Months of Year** (predefined)
* And many more!

= Optional Components to do even more =
You can enable some of our included components to extend your WordPress site even further:

* **Types-only Mode** - On our Pods Settings page, you can choose to disable creating custom fields for a performance boost if you only want to use Pods for content types or you plan on using it alongside of other custom field plugins
* **Pods Templates** - Use our [template engine](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-templates/) to create templates that can be handed off to clients for care-free management
* **Markdown Syntax** - Parses [Markdown Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) for Paragraph Text / WYSIWYG fields
* **Advanced Relationships** - Add even more relationship objects including Database Tables, Multisite Networks, Multisite Sites, Themes, Page Templates (in the theme), Sidebars, Post Type Objects, and Taxonomy Objects
* **Table Storage** - Enable table-based database storage for custom fields on Post Types, Media, Users, and Comments
* **Roles and Capabilities** - Create or edit Roles for your site and customize what they have access to
* **Advanced Content Types** - Create entirely custom content types that have their own database table, and they will exist outside the normal WordPress context avoiding meta database tables
* **Pods Pages** - Create custom pages that function off of your site's URL path with wildcard support and choose the Page Template in the theme to use -- most useful paired with Advanced Content Types

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I go for Support on your plugin? =

Our primary Support is handled through our [Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/pods/). For the fastest support, you can contact us on our [Live Community Slack Chat](https://support.pods.io/chat/) in the #support channel. We do not staff our Slack channel 24/7, but we do check any questions that come through daily and reply to any unanswered questions.

We do have a community of Pods users and developers that hang out on Slack, so you're sure to get an answer quickly. We answer our Forum questions once a week with follow-up during the week as we're prioritizing resources towards restructuring and improving our documentation.

= Where do I report bugs or request features? =

If you’ve encountered a bug or have an idea for a new feature, we kindly request you to create an Issue on our GitHub Repository at [https://github.com/pods-framework/pods/issues/new](https://github.com/pods-framework/pods/issues/new). Please be very specific about what steps you did to create the issue you’re having and include any screenshots or other configuration parameters to help us recreate or isolate the issue.

= Will Pods work with my Theme? =

Most likely the answer is yes. We don't require any special CSS or display attributes to use Pods with your theme, so you should have little to no difficulty showing your content in your theme. If you encounter any issues, contact your theme developer and ask them about their support for the standard WordPress theming functions and how to use [WordPress Template Hierarchy](https://wphierarchy.com) with their theme.

== How can I translate Pods into my own language? ==

Many thanks go out to the fine folks who have helped us translate the Pods plugin into many other languages.

Join us in further translating the Pods interface on the official [Translating WordPress dashboard](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/pods)

We are also available through our [Live Community Slack Chat](https://support.pods.io/chat/) to help our translators get started and to support them on the process.

Are you looking to translate your Pods and Fields themselves? You'll want to enable the "Translate Pods" component from Pods Admin > Components.

== Screenshots ==

1. Create new content types or extend existing ones
2. Add groups of fields and manage your content type
3. Add fields of many types with individual options for each
4. Creating or extending a Post Type will add groups of fields to the Post Editor
5. Creating or extending a Taxonomy will add groups of fields to the Term Editor
6. Extending Users will add groups of fields to the User Profile and Edit forms

You don't have to write any HTML, just specify the field(s) you'd like to show and let the block do the rest for you. The block will display the Field Labels and the Field Values in a nice readable format. Display formats available include: ul, ol, dl, p, div, and table. Want to show all but a few fields? Just specify which fields to exclude if that's what you're after :) (@sc0ttkclark)

* Enhancement: You can now specify a custom display separator for repeateable fields to use when rendering. #6892 #6890 (@JoryHogeveen)
* Changed: Resetting a Pod has been removed from the Pods Admin > Edit Pods page, instead of clicking "Delete All Items" there, you can now access this directly from Pods Admin > Settings > Cleanup & Reset as the new "Delete all content for a Pod" option. You can specify the Pod you want to delete content for and it explains exactly what you can expect from running it. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: Updated Pods Admin > Help page now lists more add-ons and where to get them / get support for them. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Properly convert accents when creating a new pod and using the label to generate the pod name. #6874 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Relationship/file fields that are hidden on the screen will now have all field values referenced instead of only the first value when multiple is enabled for that field. #6913 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: `pods_query_arg()` now correctly excludes all `$_GET` parameters when passing a manual URL into the function. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Legacy WP-CLI commands for Pods are now showing up again, however they will be replaced in a future release with a more comprehensive solution. In the meantime, you can use those commands by calling `wp pods-legacy` and `wp pods-legacy-api`.

* Fixed: Resolved TinyMCE media button handling in some cases so that it checks the correct place in the field configuration. #6569 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved overflow issues in small screens for relationship field List View. #6542 (@sc0ttkclark)

* Fixed: Pod/Group/Field configurations being saved now get their checkbox boolean options properly enforced as 0/1 and sent so they are not reverted to the default value on next load. #6485 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Fields added manually through the older `pods_group_add()` function now get their field types properly recognized. #6381 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Field config overrides for requiring a field when outputting via PHP are now properly recognized by DFV JS logic for validation and form submission prevention. #6352 (@sc0ttkclark)

* Fixed: Resolve issues with values that are objects and convert them to arrays for relationship value formatting in DFV field renders. #6566 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Show the Add Media button in forms that use the post_content field. #6569 (@sc0ttkclark)
* New minimum WP version required: WordPress 5.7+ (previously: WP 5.5+)
* No minimum PHP version changes (currently: PHP 5.6+) but please be aware that PHP 7.2+ will be required for the Pods 3.0+ feature release. You should take the time to update to PHP 8.0+ because there’s major speed improvements to be had 🙂

= 2.8.23 - July 4th, 2022 =

* Tweak: Added support for exporting post types and taxonomies to PHP for debugging purposes. While logged in as an admin, add `?pods_debug_register_export=1` to expose textareas on the page to get the code. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: Added support for new `{@_current_page}` calculation value. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: Added support for calculation values in conditional display tags like `[if field="_position" value="2"]`. #6513 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved revision issues when `revisions_to_keep_limit` is set to 0 in the post type. It was supposed to see 0 and use the default revision limit. Instead, it was disabling the revisions for that post type. #6499 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved potential PHP warnings on certain sites by preparing SQL queries separately from other string processing. #6556 #6555 #6554 (@JoryHogeveen, @sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved potential PHP notices when getting table information in `PodsData::table()`. (@JoryHogeveen)
* Fixed: Resolved potential PHP type conversion warnings by passing `SORT_REGULAR` to `array_unique()`` in the File field saving process. (@JoryHogeveen)
* Fixed: Pods Auto Templates defaults for some fields were set to "true" and that is now treated as empty. The default for those fields are now empty as intended. This resolves notices on the Edit Pod screen about templates being used for Archives when Archives are disabled, but there was no template intentionally set for Archive. (@sc0ttkclark)

= 2.8.22.1 - July 3rd, 2022 =

* Fixed: Resolve potential PHP errors from Relationship/File field saves by ensuring consistent array structures. (@sc0ttkclark)

* Added: Are you interested in seeing how much data your Pods are storing? You can now add `&pods_include_row_counts=1` to the Pods Admin > Edit Pods URL and see how many Data Rows, Meta Rows, and Relationship Rows are associated to each pod.

* Fixed: Some times after updating to 2.8, a Pod may have orphaned fields that exist outside of groups. This normally gets handled during the first time you edit a pod but now we have an additional count check to see if the field counts match as expected when editing a pod so it can trigger that process even after the first edit in 2.8. #6384 #6302 (@sc0ttkclark)

Release post: https://pods.io/2021/10/18/pods-2-8-feature-release/

Read the full [Pods 2.8 Field Guide](https://pods.io/2021/02/11/pods-2-8-beta-1-released-and-the-field-guide-to-pods-2-8/) which includes information about all the features, enhancements, and changes in this major Pods release.

**Breaking compatibility warning:**
* New minimum required versions have been updated as follows which includes notices to let you know if you need to update something.
* New minimum WP version required: WordPress 5.5+ (previously: WP 4.5+)
* New minimum PHP version required: PHP 5.6+ (previously: PHP 5.3+) — Hey! You should take the time to update to PHP 7.4+ because there’s major speed improvements to be had 🙂
* New minimum MySQL version required: MySQL 5.5+ (previously: MySQL 5.1+)
* Refactored object handling for Pod and Field configurations — we now lazy load and pull things as-needed from the database instead of always pulling all Pods and Fields at once. It remains backward compatible in most array usage
