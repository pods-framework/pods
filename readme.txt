Pods is a framework for creating, managing, and deploying customized content types and fields for any project.

== Description ==

Manage all your custom content needs in one location with the Pods Framework.

* **Create content types** including Custom Post Types, Custom Taxonomies, and our special Advanced Content Types (ACTs get their own custom tables)
* **Extend and customize content types** including Posts, Pages, Categories, Tags, Users, and Media with one easy click
* **Create custom settings pages** easily within seconds
* **Add custom fields** to *any* content type
* **Group your fields** however you'd like into their own sections and add additional headings to help organize
* **Show your fields** anywhere using our [blocks](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-blocks/), [shortcodes](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-shortcode/), [widgets](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-widgets/), or the non-coder [Pods Template](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-templates/) approach along with our [automatic theme integration](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-templates/auto-templates/)
* **Create connections** between any of your content with [relationship fields](https://docs.pods.io/fields/relationship/) to keep your content organized

Let Pods help you grow your development and site building skills so that you can manage content beyond the standard WordPress Posts & Pages.

Check out our [Documentation](https://docs.pods.io/), [Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/pods/), and our [Live Community Slack Chat](https://support.pods.io/chat/) for assistance building your dream project with Pods.

= Introduction =

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYEE2i3nPOM]

= Content types that evolve with your needs =

Create any type of content that you want -- small or large -- we've got you covered. Every content type created with Pods gets all the love it needs to grow up big and strong. You'll get an easy-to-use interface that lets you manage field groups, custom fields, and how your content type will look or function.

= Create new content types =

With Pods, you can create entirely new content types and settings pages.

= Every Field Type, FREE =

If you choose to use Pods for your custom fields, you'll get every field type you need, free of charge. Pods works great alongside [other custom field plugins](https://comparewp.org/cck) like [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) too.

We have an extensive collection of over [25 different input types to choose from on 20+ different field types for any content structure](https://docs.pods.io/fields/). Each field type comes with their own additional options to help you customize content entry and display.

You can also control visibility by role/capability and [other advanced options](https://docs.pods.io/fields/settings-advanced/).

* **Text:** Plain Text, Website, Phone, Email, Password
* **Paragraph:** Plain Paragraph Text, WYSIWYG (Visual Editor), Code (Syntax Highlighting)
* **Date / Time:** Date and Time, Date, Time
* **Number:** Plain Number, Currency (30+ international currencies)
* **Relationships / Media:** File / Image / Video (Media library and basic upload options available), Avatar (for extended Users), oEmbed, Relationship (Dropdown, Multi Select, Autocomplete, Checkboxes, Radio Buttons, and List View available)
* **Checkbox** (Yes / No)
* **Color Picker**

= Relationships to rule the world with =

The power is in your hands with our comprehensive support to **relate your content to anything**.

* **Custom defined lists** of text options
* Relate to any **Post Type or Taxonomy** posts / terms
* Relate to any **User** profile
* Relate to **User Roles or Capabilities**
* Relate to any **Comment**

And many other relationships are also available including:

* **Image Sizes**
* **Navigation Menus**
* Relate to content within **any Database Table**
* **Countries** (predefined)
* **US States** (predefined)
* **Canadian Provinces** (predefined)
* **Calendar - Days of Week** (predefined)
* **Calendar - Months of Year** (predefined)
* And many more!

= Optional Components to do even more =
You can enable some of our included components to extend your WordPress site even further:

* **Types-only Mode** - On our Pods Settings page, you can choose to disable creating custom fields for a performance boost if you only want to use Pods for content types or you plan on using it alongside of other custom field plugins
* **Pods Templates** - Use our [template engine](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-templates/) to create templates that can be handed off to clients for care-free management
* **Markdown Syntax** - Parses [Markdown Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) for Paragraph Text / WYSIWYG fields
* **Advanced Relationships** - Add even more relationship objects including Database Tables, Multisite Networks, Multisite Sites, Themes, Page Templates (in the theme), Sidebars, Post Type Objects, and Taxonomy Objects
* **Table Storage** - Enable table-based database storage for custom fields on Post Types, Media, Users, and Comments
* **Roles and Capabilities** - Create or edit Roles for your site and customize what they have access to
* **Advanced Content Types** - Create entirely custom content types that have their own database table, and they will exist outside the normal WordPress context avoiding meta database tables
* **Pods Pages** - Create custom pages that function off of your site's URL path with wildcard support and choose the Page Template in the theme to use -- most useful paired with Advanced Content Types

= Plays well with others =

We also do our best to integrate and play nicely with other projects:

* **Plugins we've integrated with**
 * [Beaver Builder](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/) and [Beaver Themer](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/beaver-themer/) using the free [Pods Beaver Themer Add-On](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pods-beaver-builder-themer-add-on/)
 * [Codepress Admin Columns](https://wordpress.org/plugins/codepress-admin-columns/) using the [Pods Add-On for Admin Columns Pro](https://www.admincolumns.com/pods/)
 * [Conductor](https://conductorplugin.com/)
 * [Gravity Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/) using the free [Pods Gravity Forms Add-on](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pods-gravity-forms/)

1. Activate this plugin

OR you can just install it with WordPress by going to Plugins >> Add New >> and type this plugin's name

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I go for Support on your plugin? =

Our primary Support is handled through our [Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/pods/). For the fastest support, you can contact us on our [Live Community Slack Chat](https://support.pods.io/chat/) in the #support channel. We do not staff our Slack channel 24/7, but we do check any questions that come through daily and reply to any unanswered questions.

We do have a community of Pods users and developers that hang out on Slack, so you're sure to get an answer quickly. We answer our Forum questions once a week with follow-up during the week as we're prioritizing resources towards restructuring and improving our documentation.

= Where do I report bugs or request features? =

If you’ve encountered a bug or have an idea for a new feature, we kindly request you to create an Issue on our GitHub Repository at [https://github.com/pods-framework/pods/issues/new](https://github.com/pods-framework/pods/issues/new). Please be very specific about what steps you did to create the issue you’re having and include any screenshots or other configuration parameters to help us recreate or isolate the issue.

= Will Pods work with my Theme? =

Most likely the answer is yes. We don't require any special CSS or display attributes to use Pods with your theme, so you should have little to no difficulty showing your content in your theme. If you encounter any issues, contact your theme developer and ask them about their support for the standard WordPress theming functions and how to use [WordPress Template Hierarchy](https://wphierarchy.com) with their theme.

== How can I translate Pods into my own language? ==

Many thanks go out to the fine folks who have helped us translate the Pods plugin into many other languages.

Join us in further translating the Pods interface on the official [Translating WordPress dashboard](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/pods)

We are also available through our [Live Community Slack Chat](https://support.pods.io/chat/) to help our translators get started and to support them on the process.

Are you looking to translate your Pods and Fields themselves? You'll want to enable the "Translate Pods" component from Pods Admin > Components.

== Screenshots ==

1. Create new content types or extend existing ones
2. Add groups of fields and manage your content type
3. Add fields of many types with individual options for each
4. Creating or extending a Post Type will add groups of fields to the Post Editor
5. Creating or extending a Taxonomy will add groups of fields to the Term Editor
6. Extending Users will add groups of fields to the User Profile and Edit forms

== Contributors ==

Pods really wouldn't be where it is without all the contributions from our [donors](https://friends.pods.io) and [code/support contributors](https://github.com/pods-framework/pods/graphs/contributors).

== Changelog ==

= 2.8.19 - June 13th, 2022 =

= 2.8.17 - May 11th, 2022 =

* Fixed: Attempting to catch potential issues where an issue is detected with loading the Tribe Common library by introducing a wrapper function `pods_container()` to be used before calling `tribe()`. (@sc0ttkclark)

= 2.8.16 - May 6th, 2022 =

* Added: More compatibility with Advanced Relationship Storage Add-On from Pods Pro by SKCDEV which allows for saving table-based relationship fields during the normal save process. (@sc0ttkclark)

= 2.8.15 - April 16th, 2022 =

* Added: New `pods_callback` support in `Pods::find()` so that you can pass a callback function to use for `pods()` usage with relationships using the `output` as "pods". This allows for using shared instances across large data sets to reduce time. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: New property `$data->fetch_full` added to `PodsData` which can be used to turn off additional fetch requests when all table data was already returned by the query with `t.*`. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: When using table-based fields and a non-simple relationship has a field in the table, it will still be expanded like a normal relationship field when requesting it by name with no traversal. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Call `PodsField_Pick::simple_objects()` using the object instead of statically to prevent PHP notices. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Adjust the `Pods\REST\V1\Endpoints\Base::check_permission()` method so that it references the correct `\Pods` object. (@sc0ttkclark)

* Added: New `pods_podsrel_enabled()` arguments to allow filtering based on the field and context. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: New `pods_data_build_pre_traverse_args` filter allows for overriding the find/replace/traverse/params arguments for a `PodsData::build()` request before relationship traversal runs. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: New `pods_data_traverse_recurse_handle_join` filter allows for overriding the JOIN SQL used for relationship traversal. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved potential PHP issues with path checks in `PodsView` on certain environments. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: When a slug is set on a Pods Page, if the slug value comes through as empty due to a path issue, it will now enforce a 404 as expected. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved a few issues with the old field data coming through to the `pods_api_save_field_old_definition` filter. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: No longer showing WPDB errors from WPDB when query errors are forced off. (@sc0ttkclark)

= 2.8.13 - April 10th, 2022 =

* Fixed: Fix Auto Template logic for detecting taxonomy archives to get the correct pod name from the associated term. #6368 #6490 (@JoryHogeveen)

= 2.8.11 - April 8th, 2022 =

* Added: You can now enable types-only mode for Pods under Pods Admin > Settings. This new mode will disallow adding and managing custom groups/fields. You can force it on by defining `PODS_META_TYPES_ONLY` as true in your wp-config.php too. #6437 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: Now you can limit relationship fields that relate to post types to only include posts that match the current post's author. #4291 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: JS API - Now you can hook into right after the Pods form fields have loaded by using `window.PodsDFV.hooks.addAction( 'pods_init_complete', 'pods/dfv', () => {} );` #6482 (@zrothauser, @sc0ttkclark)
* Added: JS API - New JS helper functions to interact with fields on the screen including `window.PodsDFV.getField( pod, itemId, fieldName, formCounter )`, `window.PodsDFV.getFields( pod, itemId, formCounter )`, `window.PodsDFV.getFieldValue( pod, itemId, fieldName, formCounter )`, `window.PodsDFV.setFieldValue( pod, itemId, fieldName, value, formCounter )`. #6471 #6475 (@zrothauser, @sc0ttkclark)
* Added: CLI - New CLI command `wp pods playbook run` which can run playbook .json files which allow you to perform multiple tasks with the Pods API. Useful for coordinating renames of Pods, Groups, and Fields, along with other CLI tasks between different environments. #6460 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Limit by post status option has been resolved but you may need to re-save your post status choices again. #6470 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Duplicated Pods now properly set the groups for the duplicated fields. If you have a Pod that is missing fields, try adding `&pods_debug_find_orphan_fields=1` to your edit pod URL and it should automatically fix them for you. #6463 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Advanced Content Type modals now close as expected when saving them within Flexible Relationships (Add New / Edit links for a relationship). #6457 #6481 (@zrothauser)
* Fixed: Thumbnails in file lists now properly scale down as expected. #6473 #6474 (@JoryHogeveen)
* Fixed: Simple Relationships now properly save once again for Settings pods. #6476 (@sc0ttkclark)

* Fixed: Disabled Tribe Common shortcode handling (when loading TC for Pods in independent-mode). #6438 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved issue with the editor instance appearing over the dropdown select field options. #6452 #6453 (@JoryHogeveen)

= 2.8.10 - February 1st, 2022 =

* Fixed: Meta compatibility fix for when it was not saving to meta through direct update meta calls. #6429 #6431 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Don't render the wrapper HTML for blocks if the contents are empty. (@sc0ttkclark)

= 2.8.9 - January 31st, 2022 =

* Added: There's a new tool at Pods Admin > Settings > Tools that will let you "Recreate missing tables". This will run the logic used to create those tables needed by Pods. This is currently just for `wp_podsrel` but will eventually include all other table-based Pods too. #5795 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: Are you interested in seeing how much data your Pods are storing? You can now add `&pods_include_row_counts=1` to the Pods Admin > Edit Pods URL and see how many Data Rows, Meta Rows, and Relationship Rows are associated to each pod. This is a hidden feature and will be added in the future as a link directly within the Edit Pods screen. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: Support for alignment and custom classes on Pods Blocks. Disabled support for Anchors until they are officially resolved for dynamic blocks in core. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: Hooks implemented for new compatibility with the Pods Pro by SKCDEV Add On for Advanced Relationship Storage. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Abstracted the meta saving into `PodsMeta::save_meta()` so that it can be used to remove duplicate logic in other methods and implemented it for meta fallback for simple relationship compatibility saving in integrations like Paid Membership Pro. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved single/double quotes that were getting converted to HTML entities for Custom Post Type singular/plural labels. #6399 #6394 (@JoryHogeveen)
* Fixed: Additional work on preventing unnecessary queries from other plugins with our Meta API integration. #6379 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Groups now properly check their access rights before showing. #6377 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved deprecation notices where we still called `pods_ui_message()`, replaced with `pods_message()`. #6340 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved issues with 00:00 times when HTML5 inputs are enabled for Date/Time fields. #6256 #6382 (@zrothauser, @sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Some times after updating to 2.8, a Pod may have orphaned fields that exist outside of groups. This normally gets handled during the first time you edit a pod but now we have an additional count check to see if the field counts match as expected when editing a pod so it can trigger that process even after the first edit in 2.8. #6384 #6302 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Cleaned up and abstracted the logic to build the field name used in DB queries for a field. #6270 #6411 (@sc0ttkclark, @jamesgol)
* Fixed: Resolved Date/Time field issues on certain browsers/OS combinations. #6318 #6300 (@sc0ttkclark, @zrothauser)
* Fixed: No longer showing the pagination links if there's just one page. #5184 (@sc0ttkclark)

* Fixed: Relationships now properly respect the depth provided in the field settings for REST API responses. #6373 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Better prevent recursive loops when saving meta from third parties. #6391 (@sc0ttkclark, @mircobabini)
* Fixed: Resolve pods_data usage in `PodsAPI::import()`. #6404 (@sc0ttkclark, @LN-MDeRuscio)
* Fixed: Multiple block collections registered through Pods now works as expected. #6403 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Groups now remove from the screen after deleting them. The group was deleted before but it wasn't removed from the screen which caused confusion. #6395 #6396 (@zrothauser, @sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved PHP warning in PHP 8+ on 404 pages for taxonomy terms. #6383 #6387 (@JoryHogeveen)
* Fixed: Reordering relationships for all inputs that support that has been resolved. #6206 #6094 #6390 (@zrothauser)
* Fixed: Resolved issues with newly added items being added to the multi-select input. #6216 #6385 (@zrothauser)
* Fixed: Improved appearance for Add New modal sizes. #6364 #6365 (@JoryHogeveen)

* Tweak: Exclude post types and taxonomies more uniformly and allow filtering the ignored types with the filter `pods_meta_ignored_types`. You can check whether a content type is covered by calling `PodsMeta::is_type_covered( $content_type, $object_name )`. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved conflicts with Ultimate Member plugin by disabling Object Field access in meta data functions. You can enable access to these fields by returning true on the `pods_meta_cover_object_fields_in_meta` filter going forward. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Ensure Number formatting is normalized for all number/currency inputs to prevent issues with decimal/thousands formats. #6269 #6356 #6333 (@JoryHogeveen)
* Fixed: Pods Pages now loads the expected value for page_template when editing a Pod Page. #6355 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Pods Pages now loads the labels for Associated Pod when editing a Pod Page. #6355 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Prevent potential timeouts by reducing areas of conflict in `PodsMeta`. #6349 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved potential performance issues / timeouts with large datasets and many Pods Blocks when loading Block Editor by adding the filter `pods_blocks_types_preload_block` and returning `false` to disable preloading blocks on load of the edit post screen. #6349 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Enforce slug characters on registration of post type / taxonomy instead of the admin config field for Custom Rewrite Slug and Archive Page Slug Override. #6354 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolve issues with `PodsAPI::save_field()` when trying to save a field just using the name, now you can pass the `override` parameter as true to bypass duplicate field checks to force saving as matching field. #6345 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: More robust checking for conflicts with extended post types and taxonomies before registering them. #6348 #6342 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved bug with Form, Item List, and Item Single blocks so they get the correct context from the Query blocks when rendering. #6351 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Use `copy()` instead of `file_get_contents()` in `pods_attachment_import()`. (@sc0ttkclark)

= 2.8.7 - December 1st, 2021 =

* Fixed: Solved issue where some shortcodes were not processed properly in templates. #6337 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Prevent conflicts with get_metadata integrations causing recursive loops. (@sc0ttkclark)

* Security: Escape/KSES labels and descriptions in more places. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: Added bbPress profile form support so that Pods fields appear like the other form fields. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: Added ability enable more consistent responses with REST API relationship depths. Filter `pods_api_export_pod_item_level_export_ids_at_final_depth` and return true to only export IDs at the final depth (note: depth set as 1 always returns IDs). #6260 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: Added ability to force checking if a Pod has orphan fields that aren't assigned to groups and setting them to the first group. Add `pods_debug_find_orphan_fields=1` to the URL when editing a pod. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: Implement Block schema for Pods blocks and set the icons to use dashicons for WordPress.org. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: Improve performance by only checking a Pod once for a field when filtering meta related functions. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: When calling pick_object and pick_val for a field object, automatically map to the corresponding method to deal with additional logic. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Flush cache after importing packages. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Adjust CSS for fields in meta boxes that are in side context. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolve issues with enqueueing assets that may not be registered yet (for bbPress compatibility) by doing a late enqueue. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolve PHP notices and added a fallback when related IDs are not set in the cache as expected. #6322 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Advanced Content Types now create the default fields as expected (name, created, modified, author, permalink) . #6314 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Added backwards compatibility for some more old Pods 1.x code, but be sure to update compatibility as this may not be maintained in the future. #6312 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Added backwards compatibility for `[if]` template tags to support running normal shortcodes in them. To enable this, set `PODS_TEMPLATES_ALLOW_OTHER_SHORTCODES` to true in your wp-config.php file. #6290 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Set up the currency configurations needed for frontend forms with currency fields (using non-USD currencies) in case they haven't been set up yet. #6315 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Added backwards compatibility for `pods_group_add()` so that when a field is marked as hidden in the UI but it is added directly with `pods_group_add()`, then it will treat it as not hidden anymore. #6309 (@sc0ttkclark)
