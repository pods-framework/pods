Pods is a framework for creating, managing, and deploying customized content types and fields for any project.

== Description ==

Manage all your custom content needs in one location with the Pods Framework.

* **Create content types** including Custom Post Types, Custom Taxonomies, and our special Advanced Content Types (ACTs get their own custom tables)
* **Extend and customize content types** including Posts, Pages, Categories, Tags, Users, and Media with one easy click
* **Create custom settings pages** easily within seconds
* **Add custom fields** to *any* content type
* **Group your fields** however you'd like into their own sections and add additional headings to help organize
* **Show your fields** anywhere using our [blocks](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-blocks/), [shortcodes](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-shortcode/), [widgets](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-widgets/), or the non-coder [Pods Template](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-templates/) approach along with our [automatic theme integration](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-templates/auto-templates/)
* **Create connections** between any of your content with [relationship fields](https://docs.pods.io/fields/relationship/) to keep your content organized

Let Pods help you grow your development and site building skills so that you can manage content beyond the standard WordPress Posts & Pages.

Check out our [Documentation](https://docs.pods.io/), [Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/pods/), and our [Live Community Slack Chat](https://support.pods.io/chat/) for assistance building your dream project with Pods.

= Introduction =

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYEE2i3nPOM]

= Content types that evolve with your needs =

Create any type of content that you want -- small or large -- we've got you covered. Every content type created with Pods gets all the love it needs to grow up big and strong. You'll get an easy-to-use interface that lets you manage field groups, custom fields, and how your content type will look or function.

= Create new content types =

With Pods, you can create entirely new content types and settings pages.

= Every Field Type, FREE =

If you choose to use Pods for your custom fields, you'll get every field type you need, free of charge. Pods works great alongside [other custom field plugins](https://comparewp.org/cck) like [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) too.

We have an extensive collection of over [25 different input types to choose from on 20+ different field types for any content structure](https://docs.pods.io/fields/). Each field type comes with their own additional options to help you customize content entry and display.

You can also control visibility by role/capability and [other advanced options](https://docs.pods.io/fields/settings-advanced/).

* **Text:** Plain Text, Website, Phone, Email, Password
* **Paragraph:** Plain Paragraph Text, WYSIWYG (Visual Editor), Code (Syntax Highlighting)
* **Date / Time:** Date and Time, Date, Time
* **Number:** Plain Number, Currency (30+ international currencies)
* **Relationships / Media:** File / Image / Video (Media library and basic upload options available), Avatar (for extended Users), oEmbed, Relationship (Dropdown, Multi Select, Autocomplete, Checkboxes, Radio Buttons, and List View available)
* **Checkbox** (Yes / No)
* **Color Picker**

= Relationships to rule the world with =

The power is in your hands with our comprehensive support to **relate your content to anything**.

* **Custom defined lists** of text options
* Relate to any **Post Type or Taxonomy** posts / terms
* Relate to any **User** profile
* Relate to **User Roles or Capabilities**
* Relate to any **Comment**

And many other relationships are also available including:

* **Image Sizes**
* **Navigation Menus**
* Relate to content within **any Database Table**
* **Countries** (predefined)
* **US States** (predefined)
* **Canadian Provinces** (predefined)
* **Calendar - Days of Week** (predefined)
* **Calendar - Months of Year** (predefined)
* And many more!

= Optional Components to do even more =
You can enable some of our included components to extend your WordPress site even further:

* **Types-only Mode** - On our Pods Settings page, you can choose to disable creating custom fields for a performance boost if you only want to use Pods for content types or you plan on using it alongside of other custom field plugins
* **Pods Templates** - Use our [template engine](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-templates/) to create templates that can be handed off to clients for care-free management
* **Markdown Syntax** - Parses [Markdown Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) for Paragraph Text / WYSIWYG fields
* **Advanced Relationships** - Add even more relationship objects including Database Tables, Multisite Networks, Multisite Sites, Themes, Page Templates (in the theme), Sidebars, Post Type Objects, and Taxonomy Objects
* **Table Storage** - Enable table-based database storage for custom fields on Post Types, Media, Users, and Comments
* **Roles and Capabilities** - Create or edit Roles for your site and customize what they have access to
* **Advanced Content Types** - Create entirely custom content types that have their own database table, and they will exist outside the normal WordPress context avoiding meta database tables
* **Pods Pages** - Create custom pages that function off of your site's URL path with wildcard support and choose the Page Template in the theme to use -- most useful paired with Advanced Content Types

= Plays well with others =

We also do our best to integrate and play nicely with other projects:

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I go for Support on your plugin? =

Our primary Support is handled through our [Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/pods/). For the fastest support, you can contact us on our [Live Community Slack Chat](https://support.pods.io/chat/) in the #support channel. We do not staff our Slack channel 24/7, but we do check any questions that come through daily and reply to any unanswered questions.

We do have a community of Pods users and developers that hang out on Slack, so you're sure to get an answer quickly. We answer our Forum questions once a week with follow-up during the week as we're prioritizing resources towards restructuring and improving our documentation.

= Where do I report bugs or request features? =

If you’ve encountered a bug or have an idea for a new feature, we kindly request you to create an Issue on our GitHub Repository at [https://github.com/pods-framework/pods/issues/new](https://github.com/pods-framework/pods/issues/new). Please be very specific about what steps you did to create the issue you’re having and include any screenshots or other configuration parameters to help us recreate or isolate the issue.

= Will Pods work with my Theme? =

Most likely the answer is yes. We don't require any special CSS or display attributes to use Pods with your theme, so you should have little to no difficulty showing your content in your theme. If you encounter any issues, contact your theme developer and ask them about their support for the standard WordPress theming functions and how to use [WordPress Template Hierarchy](https://wphierarchy.com) with their theme.

== How can I translate Pods into my own language? ==

Many thanks go out to the fine folks who have helped us translate the Pods plugin into many other languages.

Join us in further translating the Pods interface on the official [Translating WordPress dashboard](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/pods)

We are also available through our [Live Community Slack Chat](https://support.pods.io/chat/) to help our translators get started and to support them on the process.

Are you looking to translate your Pods and Fields themselves? You'll want to enable the "Translate Pods" component from Pods Admin > Components.

== Screenshots ==

1. Create new content types or extend existing ones
2. Add groups of fields and manage your content type
3. Add fields of many types with individual options for each
4. Creating or extending a Post Type will add groups of fields to the Post Editor
5. Creating or extending a Taxonomy will add groups of fields to the Term Editor
6. Extending Users will add groups of fields to the User Profile and Edit forms

== Contributors ==

Pods really wouldn't be where it is without all the contributions from our [donors](https://friends.pods.io) and [code/support contributors](https://github.com/pods-framework/pods/graphs/contributors).

== Changelog ==

= 2.8.23 - July 4th, 2022 =

* Tweak: Added support for exporting post types and taxonomies to PHP for debugging purposes. While logged in as an admin, add `?pods_debug_register_export=1` to expose textareas on the page to get the code. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: Added support for new `{@_current_page}` calculation value. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: Added support for calculation values in conditional display tags like `[if field="_position" value="2"]`. #6513 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved revision issues when `revisions_to_keep_limit` is set to 0 in the post type. It was supposed to see 0 and use the default revision limit. Instead, it was disabling the revisions for that post type. #6499 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved potential PHP warnings on certain sites by preparing SQL queries separately from other string processing. #6556 #6555 #6554 (@JoryHogeveen, @sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved potential PHP notices when getting table information in `PodsData::table()`. (@JoryHogeveen)
* Fixed: Resolved potential PHP type conversion warnings by passing `SORT_REGULAR` to `array_unique()`` in the File field saving process. (@JoryHogeveen)
* Fixed: Pods Auto Templates defaults for some fields were set to "true" and that is now treated as empty. The default for those fields are now empty as intended. This resolves notices on the Edit Pod screen about templates being used for Archives when Archives are disabled, but there was no template intentionally set for Archive. (@sc0ttkclark) 

= 2.8.22.1 - July 3rd, 2022 =

* Fixed: Resolve potential PHP errors from Relationship/File field saves by ensuring consistent array structures. (@sc0ttkclark)

= 2.8.22 - July 3rd, 2022 =

* Added: Support `IN` and `NOT IN` comparisons for the Pods Templating `[if]` conditional shortcode that checks if the current value is/isn't within a comma-separated list of values. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: Support `=` and `!=` comparisons when the current value is an array of values, it now confirms the value is/isn't within that array. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: When saving pod items, support field-type specific save method for non-tableless field types for future flexibility. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: New `pods_query_prepare()` function maps to `pods_query()` but allows for distinct prepare usage instead of confusing array syntax. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: Added new `Field::get_single_multi()` helper method to determine whether a field is using a single/multi format type. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: When saving pod items, pre-process tableless field type data consistently to better support table-based storage. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: When saving pod items, allow filtering the list of processed data values that will be used to do the final save with `pods_api_save_pod_item_processed_data_to_save`. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: Adjusted the prepared SQL statements to use the new `pods_query_prepare()` when doing `wp_podsrel` table relationship lookups. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: Filter `wp_podsrel` table relationship lookup related IDs the same way as meta-based related IDs get with the `pods_api_lookup_related_items_related_ids_for_id` filter. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: Support custom heading tags for the Heading field in the DFV-powered areas like the Edit Pod screen. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: Further lock down custom heading tags in PHP-powered forms so that they can only contain basic tag names. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Avoid setting post terms that are empty when saving pod item. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Dot-traversal in Pods Templating `[if]` conditional shortcodes references the correct pod and expected field path. (@sc0ttkclark)

= 2.8.21 - June 27th, 2022 =

* Tweak: Allow language relationships with Polylang language taxonomy. #6541 #6540 (@JoryHogeveen)
* Fixed: When determining the first version installed of Pods, use the last known version instead of the current version. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Increase the version used when determining defaults for Meta Integration and Meta Overrides. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Remove empty values from list of file types to prevent PHP warnings. #6544 #6543 (@JoryHogeveen)
* Fixed: Prevent errors on List Select fields if there are empty results. #6536 #6536 (@zrothauser)

= 2.8.20 - June 17th, 2022 =

* Fixed: Use the correct defaults for the new Pods Settings of Meta Integration and Meta Overrides. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Use the correct defaults for Pods Settings when they return as a blank string. (@sc0ttkclark)

* Added: New function `Pods::is_valid()` replaces the logic in `Pods::valid()` to better follow the naming pattern used elsewhere in Pods. `Pods::valid()` is not deprecated yet. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: New functions `pods_static_cache_get()`, `pods_static_cache_set()`, and `pods_static_cache_clear()` abstract the static cache handling that would sometimes fail if the class was not available. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: New filter `pods_init_register_assets_load_pods_dfv_on_front` which allows you to force loading Pods DFV scripts on the front of the site when needed. Normally they will be included but some plugins/themes may need them enqueued sooner. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: Improved performance when using TranslatePress by optimizing how settings and blocks are handled to avoid extra `__()` translation calls. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: Improved performance with Block configurations. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: Improved performance with existing content type checks. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: Improved performance by offering a new setting to enable/disable tracking changed fields. (@sc0ttkclark)

* Fixed: Support labels for HTML field types in more form areas. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: `PodsUI` now filters all field values instead of circumventing that when it's pulled from the table row already. (@sc0ttkclark)

= 2.8.17 - May 11th, 2022 =

* Fixed: Attempting to catch potential issues where an issue is detected with loading the Tribe Common library by introducing a wrapper function `pods_container()` to be used before calling `tribe()`. (@sc0ttkclark)

= 2.8.16 - May 6th, 2022 =

* Added: More compatibility with Advanced Relationship Storage Add-On from Pods Pro by SKCDEV which allows for saving table-based relationship fields during the normal save process. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Booleans when saving to the database now prepare as `%d` instead of the generic `%s`. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Additional SV file escaping on exports to prevent formulas from evaluating in certain spreadsheet apps unexpectedly. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: The old Pods / Pods API CLI commands were unintentionally removed in Pods 2.8 and they have now been brought back as `wp pods-legacy` and `wp pods-legacy-api`. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Improved the text / link for registering connections on Post Types and Taxonomies so they reference the correct object type. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Multi-select fields were not saving properly in certain forms. #6498 #6216 (@zrothauser)
* Confirmed compatibility with WordPress 6.0.

= 2.8.15 - April 16th, 2022 =

* Added: New `pods_callback` support in `Pods::find()` so that you can pass a callback function to use for `pods()` usage with relationships using the `output` as "pods". This allows for using shared instances across large data sets to reduce time. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: New property `$data->fetch_full` added to `PodsData` which can be used to turn off additional fetch requests when all table data was already returned by the query with `t.*`. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: When using table-based fields and a non-simple relationship has a field in the table, it will still be expanded like a normal relationship field when requesting it by name with no traversal. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Call `PodsField_Pick::simple_objects()` using the object instead of statically to prevent PHP notices. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Adjust the `Pods\REST\V1\Endpoints\Base::check_permission()` method so that it references the correct `\Pods` object. (@sc0ttkclark)

= 2.8.14 - April 15th, 2022 =

* Added: New `pods_podsrel_enabled()` arguments to allow filtering based on the field and context. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: New `pods_data_build_pre_traverse_args` filter allows for overriding the find/replace/traverse/params arguments for a `PodsData::build()` request before relationship traversal runs. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: New `pods_data_traverse_recurse_handle_join` filter allows for overriding the JOIN SQL used for relationship traversal. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved potential PHP issues with path checks in `PodsView` on certain environments. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: When a slug is set on a Pods Page, if the slug value comes through as empty due to a path issue, it will now enforce a 404 as expected. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved a few issues with the old field data coming through to the `pods_api_save_field_old_definition` filter. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: No longer showing WPDB errors from WPDB when query errors are forced off. (@sc0ttkclark)

= 2.8.13 - April 10th, 2022 =

* Fixed: Fix Auto Template logic for detecting taxonomy archives to get the correct pod name from the associated term. #6368 #6490 (@JoryHogeveen)

= 2.8.11 - April 8th, 2022 =

* Added: You can now enable types-only mode for Pods under Pods Admin > Settings. This new mode will disallow adding and managing custom groups/fields. You can force it on by defining `PODS_META_TYPES_ONLY` as true in your wp-config.php too. #6437 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: Now you can limit relationship fields that relate to post types to only include posts that match the current post's author. #4291 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: JS API - Now you can hook into right after the Pods form fields have loaded by using `window.PodsDFV.hooks.addAction( 'pods_init_complete', 'pods/dfv', () => {} );` #6482 (@zrothauser, @sc0ttkclark)
* Added: JS API - New JS helper functions to interact with fields on the screen including `window.PodsDFV.getField( pod, itemId, fieldName, formCounter )`, `window.PodsDFV.getFields( pod, itemId, formCounter )`, `window.PodsDFV.getFieldValue( pod, itemId, fieldName, formCounter )`, `window.PodsDFV.setFieldValue( pod, itemId, fieldName, value, formCounter )`. #6471 #6475 (@zrothauser, @sc0ttkclark)
* Added: CLI - New CLI command `wp pods playbook run` which can run playbook .json files which allow you to perform multiple tasks with the Pods API. Useful for coordinating renames of Pods, Groups, and Fields, along with other CLI tasks between different environments. #6460 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Limit by post status option has been resolved but you may need to re-save your post status choices again. #6470 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Duplicated Pods now properly set the groups for the duplicated fields. If you have a Pod that is missing fields, try adding `&pods_debug_find_orphan_fields=1` to your edit pod URL and it should automatically fix them for you. #6463 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Advanced Content Type modals now close as expected when saving them within Flexible Relationships (Add New / Edit links for a relationship). #6457 #6481 (@zrothauser)
* Fixed: Thumbnails in file lists now properly scale down as expected. #6473 #6474 (@JoryHogeveen)
* Fixed: Simple Relationships now properly save once again for Settings pods. #6476 (@sc0ttkclark)

* Fixed: Resolved issue with the editor instance appearing over the dropdown select field options. #6452 #6453 (@JoryHogeveen)

= 2.8.10 - February 1st, 2022 =

* Fixed: Meta compatibility fix for when it was not saving to meta through direct update meta calls. #6429 #6431 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Don't render the wrapper HTML for blocks if the contents are empty. (@sc0ttkclark)

= 2.8.9 - January 31st, 2022 =

* Added: There's a new tool at Pods Admin > Settings > Tools that will let you "Recreate missing tables". This will run the logic used to create those tables needed by Pods. This is currently just for `wp_podsrel` but will eventually include all other table-based Pods too. #5795 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: Are you interested in seeing how much data your Pods are storing? You can now add `&pods_include_row_counts=1` to the Pods Admin > Edit Pods URL and see how many Data Rows, Meta Rows, and Relationship Rows are associated to each pod. This is a hidden feature and will be added in the future as a link directly within the Edit Pods screen. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: Support for alignment and custom classes on Pods Blocks. Disabled support for Anchors until they are officially resolved for dynamic blocks in core. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Added: Hooks implemented for new compatibility with the Pods Pro by SKCDEV Add On for Advanced Relationship Storage. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Abstracted the meta saving into `PodsMeta::save_meta()` so that it can be used to remove duplicate logic in other methods and implemented it for meta fallback for simple relationship compatibility saving in integrations like Paid Membership Pro. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved single/double quotes that were getting converted to HTML entities for Custom Post Type singular/plural labels. #6399 #6394 (@JoryHogeveen)
* Fixed: Additional work on preventing unnecessary queries from other plugins with our Meta API integration. #6379 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Groups now properly check their access rights before showing. #6377 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved deprecation notices where we still called `pods_ui_message()`, replaced with `pods_message()`. #6340 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved issues with 00:00 times when HTML5 inputs are enabled for Date/Time fields. #6256 #6382 (@zrothauser, @sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Some times after updating to 2.8, a Pod may have orphaned fields that exist outside of groups. This normally gets handled during the first time you edit a pod but now we have an additional count check to see if the field counts match as expected when editing a pod so it can trigger that process even after the first edit in 2.8. #6384 #6302 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Cleaned up and abstracted the logic to build the field name used in DB queries for a field. #6270 #6411 (@sc0ttkclark, @jamesgol)
* Fixed: Resolved Date/Time field issues on certain browsers/OS combinations. #6318 #6300 (@sc0ttkclark, @zrothauser)
* Fixed: No longer showing the pagination links if there's just one page. #5184 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved PHP warnings with the Pods Blocks that may occur due to variations on how the data is provided to the block. #6367 #6386 #6388 (@JoryHogeveen, @sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Relationships now properly respect the depth provided in the field settings for REST API responses. #6373 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Better prevent recursive loops when saving meta from third parties. #6391 (@sc0ttkclark, @mircobabini)
* Fixed: Resolve pods_data usage in `PodsAPI::import()`. #6404 (@sc0ttkclark, @LN-MDeRuscio)
* Fixed: Multiple block collections registered through Pods now works as expected. #6403 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Groups now remove from the screen after deleting them. The group was deleted before but it wasn't removed from the screen which caused confusion. #6395 #6396 (@zrothauser, @sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved PHP warning in PHP 8+ on 404 pages for taxonomy terms. #6383 #6387 (@JoryHogeveen)
* Fixed: Reordering relationships for all inputs that support that has been resolved. #6206 #6094 #6390 (@zrothauser)
* Fixed: Resolved issues with newly added items being added to the multi-select input. #6216 #6385 (@zrothauser)
* Fixed: Improved appearance for Add New modal sizes. #6364 #6365 (@JoryHogeveen)

= 2.8.8.1 - December 8th, 2021 =

* Fixed: Resolve issues with going to Add New Pod screen and not seeing expected post types / taxonomies to be extended. #6358 #6359 (@JoryHogeveen)
* Fixed: Slider formatting for input now supports more varied separators and decimal characters. #6357 #6361 (@JoryHogeveen)

= 2.8.8 - December 7th, 2021 =

* Tweak: Support passing the object into specific field functions/helpers using the filter `pods_helper_include_obj` and returning `true`. (@sc0ttkclark)
