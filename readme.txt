Pods is a CMS (Content Management System) framework for WordPress.

== Description ==

Pods is a CMS framework that lets you create, manage, and display your own content types. Don't bother hacking blog posts into becoming something they're not. With Pods, create entirely new data structures with only the fields you need. Like Drupal CCK, you can set up relationships, allowing for a whole new level of interconnectedness.

If you've been looking for a clean, lightweight alternative to Drupal/CCK or Joomla, then look no further.
