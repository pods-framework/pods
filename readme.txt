Pods is a framework for creating, managing, and deploying customized content types and fields.

== Description ==

Check out http://pods.io/ for our User Guide, Forums, and other resources to help you develop with Pods.

= Introduction =
[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkBDNOAQJxg]

= Content types that evolve with your needs =
Create any type of content that you want -- small or large -- we've got you covered. Every content type created with Pods gets all the love it needs to grow up big and strong. You'll get an easy to use interface that lets you manage custom fields and how your content type will function.

We now give you the power you've never before had with a single plugin because we've reimagined how to manage content types from the ground up.

= Create new content types =
With Pods, you can create entirely new content types:

* Custom Post Types - Content types that look and function like Posts and Pages, but in their own separate areas
* Custom Taxonomies - Content types that look and function like Categories and Tags, but in their own separate areas
* Custom Settings Pages - Create custom admin forms under Settings to help organize your site's custom global settings
* Advanced Content Types - These are entirely separate from WordPress and function off their own database tables

= Extend existing content types =
Not satisfied? How about the power of being able to extend existing content types? We've got you covered with extending these major WordPress objects:

* Post Types - Create and manage fields for any existing Post Type (Posts, Pages, etc), even those created by plugins or themes
* Taxonomies - Create and manage fields for any existing Taxonomies (Categories, Tags, etc), even those created by plugins or themes
* Media - Create and manage fields for your media uploads, easily add additional information and context to any file you want
* Users - Create and manage fields for your user profiles, this is truly the bees knees!
* Comments - Create and manage fields for your visitor comments, easily add fields to fit the way you use comments as reviews and more

= Use our field types, or make your own =
We have a lot of common field types available for you to use, or you can build your own with our extensible field type classes.

Each of these field type have their own set of options, if those aren't enough they are also easily extended:

* Date / Time - Date, Time, or both
* Number - Plain Number or Currency
* Text - Plain Text, Website, Phone, E-mail, or Password
* Paragraph Text - Plain Paragraph, WYSIWYG (TinyMCE or CLEditor, or add your own), or Code (Syntax Highlighting)
* Color Picker - Choose colors, because colors are great
* Yes / No - You can't really go wrong with a checkbox, but we've added a few charms to make it stand out
* File / Image / Video - Upload new media or select from existing ones with our Media Library integration, or use a simple uploader, your choice
* Avatars - Upload new media or select from existing ones, automatically integrates with get_avatar calls for Users extended by Pods
* Relationships - Relate any item, to any item of any WP object type, another Pod, or a custom user-defined list -- with bidirectional relationships

= Relationships to rule the world with =

* Custom defined list
* Post Types
* Taxonomies
* Users
* User Roles
* User Capabilities
* Media
* Comments

And many other relationships are also available including:

* Image Sizes
* Navigation Menus
* Post Formats
* Post Status
* Sidebars
* Countries (predefined)
* US States (predefined)

= Easily display your content =
There are several ways to get Pods data to show up throughout your site, but with any WP object type you create or extend with Pods, you can use all of the functions and methods you're already used to with the core WordPress API / Loop -- out of the box!

Additionally, we have a United Theming API that lets you theme your content types across every type of Pod, regardless if it's a post type or taxonomy or user, or.. you get the picture.

= Customized Management Panels =
Utilize Pods UI (included in Pods 1.10+) to build your own Custom Management panels for your Pods.

= Optional Components to do even more =
You can enable some of our included components to extend your WordPress site even further:

* Roles and Capabilities - Create or edit Roles for your site, and customize their corresponding capabilities
* Pages - Create custom pages that function off of your site's path, with wildcard support, and choose the Page Template to use
* Templates - Use our template engine to create templates that can be handed off to clients for carefree management
* Helpers - Customize how Pods works right from the admin area with simple to advanced reusable code snippets
* Advanced Content Types - These types of content were built into Pods prior to 2.3, but are now optionally enabled
* Table Storage - Enable table-based storage for custom fields on Post Types, Media, Users, and Comments. Also adds the ability to add custom fields to Taxonomies
* Advanced Relationships - Add advanced relationship objects for relating to including Database Tables, Multisite Networks, Multisite Sites, Themes, Page Templates, Sidebars, Post Type Objects, and Taxonomy Objects
* Markdown Syntax - Parses Markdown Syntax for Paragraph Text / WYSIWYG fields
* Builder theme integration - Use our tightly integrated modules for Builder in your layouts

= Migrate to Pods, find out what you've been missing =
Using another solution? We've built additional components to help you transition:

* Import from Custom Post Type UI
* More imports coming soon including Importing from Custom Field Suite, Advanced Custom Fields, and Custom Tables

= Plays well with others =
We also do our best to integrate and play nicely with other projects:

* Plugins
 * [Tabify Edit Screen](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tabify-edit-screen/)
 * [Codepress Admin Columns](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/codepress-admin-columns/)
 * [Polylang](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/polylang/)
 * [WPML](http://wpml.org/)
* Themes
 * [Builder](http://www.ithemes.com/) (iThemes)
 * [Genesis](http://www.studiopress.com/) (StudioPress)

== Installation ==

1. Unpack the entire contents of this plugin zip file into your `wp-content/plugins/` folder locally
1. Upload to your site
1. Navigate to `wp-admin/plugins.php` on your site (your WP Admin plugin page)
1. Activate this plugin

OR you can just install it with WordPress by going to Plugins >> Add New >> and type this plugin's name

== Screenshots ==

1. Create new content types or extend existing ones
2. Add fields of many different types, with individual options for each so you can define your content type to be what you need it to be
3. Post Type pods will add fields to the Post editor
4. Taxonomy pods will add fields to the Taxonomy forms
5. User pods will add fields to the User forms
6. Comment pods will add fields to the Comment forms
7. Media pods will add fields to the Media forms
8. Create Advanced Content Types that exist only as you define them, outside of the normal WP object structure

Those now upgrading from Pods 1.x will have their existing bidirectional fields upgraded automatically and won't have to worry about setting them up again.
* Added: Widgets are now available to use to List Pod items, Show a specific Pod item, or to Show a specific field from a Pod item much like our TinyMCE shortcode popup -- enjoy!
* Improved: Search handling has been improved along with the above tweaks

* Fixed: Some plugins/themes use the wp_title filter incorrectly and do not pass the $sep and $seplocation variables, we now set defaults in those cases
* Fixed: Some sites experienced PHP notices from the way we've been using parse_url, we now have a fallback for that handling which clears those up

= 1.14 - May 21, 2012 =
* Important Change / Addition: For installations using WordPress 3.3+, we have switched the default uploader to Plupload from SWFUpload due to incompatibilities introduced in WP 3.3.2 that effect all plugins and themes using the styled button. Be sure to update your file upload helpers using our examples at http://pods.io/packages/file-uploader-input-helpers/
* Added: edit_where_any option in Pods UI now lets you set (true/false) whether for edit_where to be an ANY or ALL match (default false = ALL)
* Fixed: Date Input field was throwing a JS error if you used YYYY-mm-dd format without the time included
* Fixed: parse_url fixes for when path isn't set (localhost or custom ports usually causes this)
* Fixed: When there was extra output above or below JSON strings like errors from other plugins, whitespace, or anything else - we now explicitly match the JSON {...} string before using it in JS to avoid confusing errors for the user
* Fixed: .pods_form style tweaks to help cover themes which display the form incorrectly
* Fixed: Forcing (int) on getRecordById when is_numeric( $id )
* Fixed: Resolved incompatibility issues with certain MySQL configurations which were throwing errors when saving a Pod

* Added: New 'pods_rel_lookup_data' filter to filter the data array itself (not just the MySQL resource given in 'pods_rel_lookup' filter above), great for customizing drop-downs for PICK fields
* Fixed: 'page' parameter in Pod::findRecords wasn't being validated as a number greater than 0, now forces a minimum of 1; Anything less will also reset the current page number, set during Pod::construct()
* Fixed: Pods UI 'label_add' wasn't being used on button at top of manage table list
* Fixed: Pagination bug with custom page_var set in Pod object, would add the custom page_var to the URL over and over
* Fixed: Upgrade script updated to include all upgrades prior to 1.6, which had been left out in a previous release
* Fixed: More strict matching in Pod::findRecords for field names, instead of just removing '(' and ')', it now removes 'function_name(' first, so that fields with the same name as function names won't be pulled

= 1.12.3 - February 19, 2012 =
* Added: Pods UI findRecords parameters array now goes through a new filter called "pods_ui_findrecords"
* Fixed: Forcing boolean check if true in bypass_helpers in PodAPI

= 1.12 - December 12, 2011 =
* Important: As with all upgrades, we take them seriously. If you experience any major issues when upgrading to this version from a previous version, immediately contact uhoh@pods.io and we'll help get your upgrade issue figured out (critical bugs only please)
* Security Update: AJAX API calls all utilize _wpnonce hashes, update your customized publicForm / input helper code AJAX (api.php and misc.php expect `wp_create_nonce('pods-' . $action)` usage)
* Added: Multi-level references in field names when referenced in Pod :: findRecords $params (`select, where, groupby, having, orderby`) - ex. `'where' =&gt; 'pick_field.another_pick_field.another_pick.field = "Example"'` **(donation-funded by @chriscarvache)**
* Added: Multi-level references in search filters when referenced in Pod :: findRecords $params (`select, where, groupby, having, orderby`) or Pod :: traverse variable (when not mentioned in params but you want it filterable) **(donation-funded by @chriscarvache)**
* Added: Lightweight Relationship (PICK) field support in Pod :: findRecords (2.0 full support in UI) **(donation-funded by @chriscarvache)**
* Added: Fully revamped JOINs based on field names when referenced in Pod :: findRecords $params (`select, where, groupby, having, orderby`) **(donation-funded by @chriscarvache)**
* Added: RegEx auto-sanitizing of field names when referenced in Pod :: findRecords $params (`select, where, groupby, having, orderby`) **(donation-funded by @chriscarvache)**
* Added: PodAPI :: duplicate_pod_item with $params as `'datatype' =&gt; 'podname', 'tbl_row_id' =&gt; $item_id_to_duplicate` (returns new id) **(donation-funded by @gr0b1)**
* Added: PodAPI :: export_pod_item with $params as `'datatype' =&gt; 'podname', 'tbl_row_id' =&gt; $item_id_to_export` (returns array of data - pick/file columns are arrays of their data) **(donation-funded by @gr0b1)**
* Added: PODS_STRICT_MODE constant to enable many features at once which are common settings for advanced developers including - Pagination defaults to off; Search defaults to off; PodAPI $params are auto-sanitized (stripslashes_deep if you already sanitized or are dealing with sanitized values in your $params)
* Added: Pod('pod_name', $params) ability to run findRecords straight away with one single line that also sets up the Pod object, $params must be an array
* Added: Option to use SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS or COUNT(*) for getting the total rows available (for use with pagination / Pod :: getTotalRows) setting 'calc_found_rows' or 'count_found_rows' to true in Pod :: findRecords $params (useful for complex queries on data)
* Added: Option to disable pagination altogether (separate from setting page to 1, but also forces page to be 1) in findRecords $params `'pagination' =&gt; false`
* Added: PODS_GLOBAL_POD_PAGINATION constant to globally disable pagination by setting the constant to false (can be renabled as needed in findRecords $params `'pagination' =&gt; true`)
* Added: PODS_GLOBAL_POD_SEARCH constant to globally disable search by setting the constant to false (can be renabled as needed in findRecords $params `'search' =&gt; true`)
* Added: PODS_GLOBAL_POD_SEARCH_MODE constant to globally set the search_mode to 'text', 'int', or 'text_like' (default 'int' which references field IDs) - can be overrided as needed in findRecords $params `'search_mode' =&gt; 'text'`)
* Added: PODS_DISABLE_EVAL constant to globally disable PHP eval() on PHP-enabled areas of Pods (Templates, Helpers, Pod Pages)
* Added: PODS_WP_VERSION_MINIMUM constant to disable WP minimum version requirement
* Added: PODS_PHP_VERSION_MINIMUM constant to disable PHP minimum version requirement
* Added: PODS_MYSQL_VERSION_MINIMUM constant to disable MySQL minimum version requirement
* Added: Pod :: getRowNumber() to get current row number and Pod :: row_number variable to internally be used to keep track of which row_number you're on in findRecords loop (incremented in fetchRecord)
* Added: Pod :: raw_sql contains SQL without @ table references replaced and Pod :: sql now should reflect the same query as hits the DB (@ table references replaced)
* Added: Pod :: getZebra() which uses a switch (Pod :: zebra) that goes from false to true during fetchRecord loops (initial value is false, first fetch switches it to true and reverses each additional fetch)
* Added: PodAPI :: save_template / save_page / save_helper now allow 'name' / 'uri' to be renamed on save (only in API, not UI)
* Added: PodAPI :: save_pod_item now accepts an array for $params-&gt;tbl_row_id which will let you save multiple items at a time using the rest of the $params
* Added: PodAPI :: delete_pod_item now accepts an array for $params-&gt;tbl_row_id which will let you delete multiple items at a time
* Added: Having trouble updating Pods but you know things should be OK (advanced users)? Try adding ?pods_bypass_update=1 to the page URL you're on to bypass the update
* Added: Pagination / Filters to pods_shortcode (ex. `[pods name="mypod" limit="15" pagination="1" pagination_label="Go to page:" pagination_location="after" filters="status,category" filters_label="Filter:" filters_location="before"]`)

* Added: Sort classes now used to show current sort direction
* Added: PodAPI :: load_column now accepts 'name' and 'datatype' (id) parameters for lookup instead of only just 'id' of field
* Added: PodAPI :: load_helper now accepts 'type' parameter for lookup instead of only just 'id' and 'name' of helper
* Added: New function 'pods_function_or_file' that checks if a function or file exists based on a number of locations, used for Helpers / Templates / Pod Pages, filter available called 'pods_function_or_file' if you want to customize further
* Changed: Pod Page Precode now runs on 'after_setup_theme' action instead of 'plugins_loaded'

* Changed: Now using wp_hash instead of md5 to get the hash of a value
* Changed: PODS_VERSION_FULL removed and PODS_VERSION now set as real point version (ex. `1.12`), updated all checks for version to use PHP version_compare

* Fixed: Pods &gt;&gt; Setup UI updated with lots of fixes when editing Pods / Columns, and Helpers (no more refreshes needed where they may have been needed before)
* Fixed: PodAPI setting of defaults for $params to avoid isset checks
* Fixed: PodAPI :: save_column now sets pick-related extra data to empty if not a pick column
* Fixed: Pod :: getRecordById() now gets all of the same data as findRecords pulls in (pod_id, created, modified)
* Fixed: pods_url_variable references updated to pods_var
* Fixed: SQL cleaned up (extra line breaks removed so it's not as ugly) and standardized to escape field names in SQL references

* Fixed: pods_var bug with strtolower PHP warning when managing content

* Fixed: PodAPI :: save_column now reserves the field names 't' and 'p' for internal use as aliases
* Fixed: Pod :: lookup_row_ids now forces (int) on values given, also allows $tbl_row_ids to be array instead of only just comma-separate string as before
* Fixed: Pod :: findRecords now looks in 'select' parameter to find fields that need to be included
* Fixed: Pod :: showform now forces (int) on explicitly values that hit the DB
* Fixed: Various PHP notice fixes and query updates to improve performance (to maximize performance on custom queries, update wp_pod queries to use datatype first then tbl_row_id if it's not already in WHERE statements, do same for wp_pod_rel on field_id and pod_id)

* Added: pods_var_set function to set variables, operates similar to pods_var, has three variables ($value, $key, $type) and returns $value on success (if $type is an array or object it will return the updated $type, if $type is 'url' it will return the full updated $url)
* Fixed: Now using get_current_url() and parse_url to get path versus $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']
* Fixed: Replaced mysql_real_escape_string usage with esc_sql
* Fixed: Backslashes being automatically added and causing issues with additional urlencoding and esc_attr usage
