Pods is a framework for creating, managing, and deploying customized content types and fields for any project.

== Description ==

Manage all your custom content needs in one location with the Pods Framework.

* **Create content types** including Custom Post Types, Custom Taxonomies, and our special Advanced Content Types (ACTs get their own custom tables)
* **Extend and customize content types** including Posts, Pages, Categories, Tags, Users, and Media with one easy click
* **Create custom settings pages** easily within seconds
* **Add custom fields** to *any* content type
* **Conditionally show fields** based on the value of other fields with Conditional Logic
* **Group your fields** however you'd like into their own sections and add additional headings to help organize
* **Show your fields** anywhere using our [blocks](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-blocks/), [shortcodes](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-shortcode/), [widgets](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-widgets/), or the non-coder [Pods Template](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-templates/) approach along with our [automatic theme integration](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-templates/auto-templates/)
* **Create connections** between any of your content with [relationship fields](https://docs.pods.io/fields/relationship/) to keep your content organized

Let Pods help you grow your development and site building skills so that you can manage content beyond the standard WordPress Posts & Pages.

Want to check it out? Give Pods a test drive with our new [One-click Demo](https://pods.io/demo/).

Check out our [Documentation](https://docs.pods.io/), [Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/pods/), and our [Live Community Slack Chat](https://support.pods.io/chat/) for assistance building your dream project with Pods.

= Introduction =

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WqKZr2gPZY]

= Content types that evolve with your needs =

Create any type of content that you want -- small or large -- we've got you covered. Every content type created with Pods gets all the love it needs to grow up big and strong. You'll get an easy-to-use interface that lets you manage field groups, custom fields, and how your content type will look or function.

= Create new content types =

With Pods, you can create entirely new content types and settings pages.

= Every Field Type, FREE =

If you choose to use Pods for your custom fields, you'll get every field type you need, free of charge. Pods works great alongside [other custom field plugins](https://comparewp.org/cck) like [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) too.

We have an extensive collection of over [25 different input types to choose from on 20+ different field types for any content structure](https://docs.pods.io/fields/). Each field type comes with their own additional options to help you customize content entry and display.

You can also control visibility by role/capability and [other advanced options](https://docs.pods.io/fields/settings-advanced/).

* **Repeatable Fields:** Turn almost any field into a repeatable field with multiple values
* **Text:** Plain Text, Website, Phone, Email, Password
* **Paragraph:** Plain Paragraph Text, WYSIWYG (Visual Editor), Code (Syntax Highlighting)
* **Date / Time:** Date and Time, Date, Time
* **Number:** Plain Number, Currency (30+ international currencies)
* **Relationships / Media:** File / Image / Video (Media library and basic upload options available), Avatar (for extended Users), oEmbed, Relationship (Dropdown, Multi Select, Autocomplete, Checkboxes, Radio Buttons, and List View available)
* **Checkbox** (Yes / No)
* **Color Picker**
* **Layout Fields:** Heading text, HTML content

= Relationships to rule the world with =

The power is in your hands with our comprehensive support to **relate your content to anything**.

* **Custom defined lists** of text options
* Relate to any **Post Type or Taxonomy** posts / terms
* Relate to any **User** profile
* Relate to **User Roles or Capabilities**
* Relate to any **Comment**

And many other relationships are also available including:

* **Image Sizes**
* **Navigation Menus**
* Relate to content within **any Database Table**
* **Countries** (predefined)
* **US States** (predefined)
* **Canadian Provinces** (predefined)
* **Calendar - Days of Week** (predefined)
* **Calendar - Months of Year** (predefined)
* And many more!

= Optional Components to do even more =
You can enable some of our included components to extend your WordPress site even further:

* **Types-only Mode** - On our Pods Settings page, you can choose to disable creating custom fields for a performance boost if you only want to use Pods for content types or you plan on using it alongside of other custom field plugins
* **Pods Templates** - Use our [template engine](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-templates/) to create templates that can be handed off to clients for care-free management
* **Markdown Syntax** - Parses [Markdown Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) for Paragraph Text / WYSIWYG fields
* **Advanced Relationships** - Add even more relationship objects including Database Tables, Multisite Networks, Multisite Sites, Themes, Page Templates (in the theme), Sidebars, Post Type Objects, and Taxonomy Objects
* **Table Storage** - Enable table-based database storage for custom fields on Post Types, Media, Users, and Comments
* **Roles and Capabilities** - Create or edit Roles for your site and customize what they have access to
* **Advanced Content Types** - Create entirely custom content types that have their own database table, and they will exist outside the normal WordPress context avoiding meta database tables
* **Pods Pages** - Create custom pages that function off of your site's URL path with wildcard support and choose the Page Template in the theme to use -- most useful paired with Advanced Content Types

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I go for Support on your plugin? =

Our primary Support is handled through our [Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/pods/). For the fastest support, you can contact us on our [Live Community Slack Chat](https://support.pods.io/chat/) in the #support channel. We do not staff our Slack channel 24/7, but we do check any questions that come through daily and reply to any unanswered questions.

We do have a community of Pods users and developers that hang out on Slack, so you're sure to get an answer quickly. We answer our Forum questions once a week with follow-up during the week as we're prioritizing resources towards restructuring and improving our documentation.

= Where do I report bugs or request features? =

If you’ve encountered a bug or have an idea for a new feature, we kindly request you to create an Issue on our GitHub Repository at [https://github.com/pods-framework/pods/issues/new](https://github.com/pods-framework/pods/issues/new). Please be very specific about what steps you did to create the issue you’re having and include any screenshots or other configuration parameters to help us recreate or isolate the issue.

= Will Pods work with my Theme? =

Most likely the answer is yes. We don't require any special CSS or display attributes to use Pods with your theme, so you should have little to no difficulty showing your content in your theme. If you encounter any issues, contact your theme developer and ask them about their support for the standard WordPress theming functions and how to use [WordPress Template Hierarchy](https://wphierarchy.com) with their theme.

== How can I translate Pods into my own language? ==

Many thanks go out to the fine folks who have helped us translate the Pods plugin into many other languages.

Join us in further translating the Pods interface on the official [Translating WordPress dashboard](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/pods)

We are also available through our [Live Community Slack Chat](https://support.pods.io/chat/) to help our translators get started and to support them on the process.

Are you looking to translate your Pods and Fields themselves? You'll want to enable the "Translate Pods" component from Pods Admin > Components.

== Screenshots ==

1. Create new content types or extend existing ones
2. Add groups of fields and manage your content type
3. Add fields of many types with individual options for each
4. Creating or extending a Post Type will add groups of fields to the Post Editor
5. Creating or extending a Taxonomy will add groups of fields to the Term Editor
6. Extending Users will add groups of fields to the User Profile and Edit forms

* Fixed: The Pods repair tool was overwriting the storage type for table-based pods to `meta`, now it uses the proper logic there and also uses a new abstracted method `Pod::get_default_storage()` for defaults when empty. The tool now also won't overwrite the table schema for each Pod to prevent unintended problems. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Resolved PHP error when using WordPress versions prior to 6.1 which did not have the `did_filter()` function that was called. (@sc0ttkclark)

* Tweak: Pods Field Output > Bypass mapping values when in the form context to prevent conflicts with Avatar fields and other fields. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Tweak: Migration > Abstracted the migration process on first edit of a Pod to detect orphaned fields on future edits with a notice on the screen about the repair. (@sc0ttkclark)

* Added: JS API - New JS helper functions to interact with fields on the screen including `window.PodsDFV.getField( pod, itemId, fieldName, formCounter )`, `window.PodsDFV.getFields( pod, itemId, formCounter )`, `window.PodsDFV.getFieldValue( pod, itemId, fieldName, formCounter )`, `window.PodsDFV.setFieldValue( pod, itemId, fieldName, value, formCounter )`. #6471 #6475 (@zrothauser, @sc0ttkclark)
* Added: CLI - New CLI command `wp pods playbook run` which can run playbook .json files which allow you to perform multiple tasks with the Pods API. Useful for coordinating renames of Pods, Groups, and Fields, along with other CLI tasks between different environments. #6460 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Limit by post status option has been resolved but you may need to re-save your post status choices again. #6470 (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Duplicated Pods now properly set the groups for the duplicated fields. If you have a Pod that is missing fields, try adding `&pods_debug_find_orphan_fields=1` to your edit pod URL and it should automatically fix them for you. #6463 (@sc0ttkclark)

* Added: Are you interested in seeing how much data your Pods are storing? You can now add `&pods_include_row_counts=1` to the Pods Admin > Edit Pods URL and see how many Data Rows, Meta Rows, and Relationship Rows are associated to each pod.

* Fixed: Resolved issues with 00:00 times when HTML5 inputs are enabled for Date/Time fields. #6256 #6382 (@zrothauser, @sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Some times after updating to 2.8, a Pod may have orphaned fields that exist outside of groups. This normally gets handled during the first time you edit a pod but now we have an additional count check to see if the field counts match as expected when editing a pod so it can trigger that process even after the first edit in 2.8. #6384 #6302 (@sc0ttkclark)

Read the full [Pods 2.8 Field Guide](https://pods.io/2021/02/11/pods-2-8-beta-1-released-and-the-field-guide-to-pods-2-8/) which includes information about all the features, enhancements, and changes in this major Pods release.

**Breaking compatibility warning:**
* New minimum required versions have been updated as follows which includes notices to let you know if you need to update something.
* New minimum WP version required: WordPress 5.5+ (previously: WP 4.5+)
* New minimum PHP version required: PHP 5.6+ (previously: PHP 5.3+) — Hey! You should take the time to update to PHP 7.4+ because there’s major speed improvements to be had 🙂
* New minimum MySQL version required: MySQL 5.5+ (previously: MySQL 5.1+)
* Refactored object handling for Pod and Field configurations — we now lazy load and pull things as-needed from the database instead of always pulling all Pods and Fields at once. It remains backward compatible in most array usage

**Features and changes in this release**
* Feature: Now you can add multiple groups of fields. (@sc0ttkclark, @zrothauser)
* Feature: Our Edit Pod screen is powered by our all new React form interfaces, tooltips, and they use our new Pods Admin REST API endpoints. (@sc0ttkclark, @zrothauser)
* Feature: All of our form fields are powered by React now in preparation for Pods 2.9 repeatable fields that we're working on next. (@sc0ttkclark, @zrothauser)
* Feature: New field types for Heading and HTML. (@sc0ttkclark, @zrothauser)
* Feature: New Pods Blocks available and the underlying Pods Block PHP API is compatible with ACF Blocks if you've ever used those before. (@sc0ttkclark, @zrothauser)
* Feature: REST API endpoints are now available to create/edit various objects: Pods, Pod Groups, and Pod Fields. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Feature: WP-CLI commands that mirror the REST API endpoints we have. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Feature: The new WYSIWYG editor option to use [Quill Editor](https://github.com/zenoamaro/react-quill) is now available and the CLEditor has been removed. (@sc0ttkclark, @zrothauser)
* Compatibility: Completely updated compatibility with WPML and Polylang plugins.
