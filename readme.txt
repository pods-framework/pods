Pods is a framework for creating, managing, and deploying customized content types and fields.

== Description ==

Manage all your custom content needs in one location with the Pods Framework.

* **Create content types** including custom post types, custom taxonomies and advanced content types using custom tables (separate from WordPress)
* **Extend and customize content types** including posts, pages, categories, tags, users, and media
* **Create custom settings pages** easily within seconds
* **Add custom fields** to *any* content type or settings page
* **Group your fields** however you'd like into their own sections
* **Show your fields** anywhere using our [shortcodes](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-shortcode/), [widgets](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/widgets/), the code-free [Pods Template](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/pods-templates/) approach, or our [automatic theme integration](https://docs.pods.io/displaying-pods/wordpress-theme-templates/)
* **Create connections** between any of your content with [relationship fields](https://docs.pods.io/fields/relationship-fields/) to keep your content organized

Let Pods help you grow your development skills and manage content beyond the standard WordPress Posts & Pages. Check out our [Documentation](https://docs.pods.io/), [Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/pods/), and our [Live Slack Chat](https://pods.io/chat/) to help you build your dream project with Pods.

= Introduction =

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYEE2i3nPOM]

= Content types that evolve with your needs =

Create any type of content that you want -- small or large -- we've got you covered. Every content type created with Pods gets all the love it needs to grow up big and strong. You'll get an easy to use interface that lets you manage field groups, custom fields, and how your content type will look or function.

= Create new content types =

With Pods, you can create entirely new content types and settings pages.

* **Custom Post Types** - Content types that look and function like Posts and Pages, but in their own separate sections of WordPress
* **Custom Taxonomies** - Content types that look and function like Categories and Tags, but in their own separate sections of WordPress
* **Custom Settings Pages** - Create custom settings under Settings menu to help organize your site's custom global settings
* **Advanced Content Types** - These are entirely separate from WordPress and function off their own database tables (much like the [Drupal CCK](https://www.drupal.org/project/cck))

= Extend existing content types =

Need to customize your existing content types in WordPress? We offer the ability to extend existing content types across all of WordPress:

* **Post Types** - Customize and create/manage fields for any existing post type -- Posts, Pages, and even those created by plugins or themes
* **Taxonomies** - Customize and create/manage fields for any existing taxonomy -- Categories, Tags, and even those created by plugins or themes
* **Media** - Create and manage fields for your media uploads to enable you to fill in additional information and context to any image/file you want
* **Users** - Create and manage fields for your user/author profiles
* **Comments** - Create and manage fields for your visitor comments, easily add fields to fit the way you use comments as reviews and more

= Field Types =

We have an extensive collection of fields that you can leverage to build the perfect content structure for your site. You can also build your own custom field types with our extensible field type classes.

* **Text**
 * Plain Text
 * Website
 * Phone
 * E-mail
 * Password
* **Paragraph**
 * Plain Paragraph Text
 * WYSIWYG (Visual Editor)
 * Code (Syntax Highlighting)
* **Date / Time**
 * Date and Time
 * Date
 * Time
* **Number**
 * Plain Number
 * Currency (30+ international currencies)
* **Relationships / Media**
 * File / Image / Video
 * Avatar (for extended Users)
 * oEmbed
 * Relationship
* **Checkbox** (Yes / No)
* **Color Picker**

= Relationships to rule the world with =

The power is in your hands with our comprehensive support to **relate your content to anything**.

* **Custom defined lists** of text options
* Relate to **Post Type** content
* Relate to **Taxonomy** content
* Relate to any **User** profile
* Relate to **User Roles**
* Relate to **User Capabilities**
* Relate to **Media** attachments
* Relate to any **Comment**

And many other relationships are also available including:

* **Templates** - Use our template engine to create templates that can be handed off to clients for care-free management
* **Advanced Relationships** - Add advanced relationship objects for relating to including Database Tables, Multisite Networks, Multisite Sites, Themes, Page Templates, Sidebars, Post Type Objects, and Taxonomy Objects
* **Advanced Content Types** - These types of content were built into Pods prior to 2.3, but are now optionally enabled
* **Table Storage** - Enable table-based storage for custom fields on Post Types, Media, Users, and Comments. Also adds the ability to add custom fields to Taxonomies
* **Markdown Syntax** - Parses Markdown Syntax for Paragraph Text / WYSIWYG fields
* **Pages** - Create custom pages that function off of your site's URL path, with wildcard support, and choose the Page Template to use

1. Activate this plugin

OR you can just install it with WordPress by going to Plugins >> Add New >> and type this plugin's name

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do we go for Support on your plugin? =

Our primary Support is handled through our [Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/pods/). For the fastest support, you can contact us on our [Live Slack Chat](https://pods.io/chat/) in the #support channel. We do not staff our Slack channel 24/7, but we do check any questions that come through daily and reply to any unanswered questions.

We do have a community of Pods users and developers that hang out on Slack so you're sure to get an answer quickly. We answer our Forum questions once a week with follow-up during the week as we're prioritizing resources towards restructuring and improving our documentation.

= I've found a Bug or I have a Feature Request =

If you’ve uncovered a Bug or have a Feature Request, we kindly request you to create an Issue on our GitHub Repository at [https://github.com/pods-framework/pods/issues/new](https://github.com/pods-framework/pods/issues/new). Please be very specific about what steps you did to create the issue you’re having and include any screenshots or other configuration parameters to help us recreate or isolate the issue.

= Will Pods work with my Theme? =

Most likely the answer is yes. We don't require any special CSS or display attributes to use Pods with your theme so you should have little to no difficulty showing your content in your theme. If you encounter any issues, contact your theme developer and ask them about their support for the standard WordPress theming functions and how to use [WordPress Template Hierarchy](https://wphierarchy.com) with their theme.

== Screenshots ==

1. Create new content types or extend existing ones
2. Add fields of many different types, with individual options for each so you can define your content type to be what you need it to be
3. Post Type pods will add fields to the Post editor
4. Taxonomy pods will add fields to the Taxonomy forms
5. User pods will add fields to the User forms
6. Comment pods will add fields to the Comment forms
7. Media pods will add fields to the Media forms
8. Create Advanced Content Types that exist only as you define them, outside of the normal WP object structure

== Contributors ==

Pods really wouldn't be where it is without all of the contributions from our [donors](https://friends.pods.io) and [code/support contributors](https://github.com/pods-framework/pods/graphs/contributors).

== Translations ==

Many thanks go out to the fine folks who have helped us translate Pods into many other languages.

Join us in further translating the Pods interface at: [https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/pods](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/pods)

We are also available through our [Live Slack Chat](https://pods.io/chat/) to help our translators get started and to support them on the process.

**New PHP & WP Minimum Version Requirements:**

* PHP Version Change Requirement 5.3+
* WP Version Change Required 4.5+

**Major Changes in 2.7 Release: Flexible Relationships:**

* New Relationship Field Format "List View": The power of the new flexible relationships is our new modal window that opens within the existing record for relationship fields. This is modeled after the Media Modal from WordPress and provides full functionality to Add New related records or edit existing records all from within the parent record of the relationship. This is provided through our new List View field format for relationship fields. To see a demo of this field in action [head on over to our YouTube](https://youtu.be/V8c067GAEcA)
* Add New with Flexible Relationships: The new flexible relationships will automatically enable Add New on all your existing relationships, but you can disable this from the Additional Options tab for each relationship field. You can switch field formats to the new List View from additional options tab as well.
* Dynamic Field Views: The relationship fields and file upload fields have been rewritten to take advantage of "Dynamic Field Views", driven by JavaScript. More technical details about the directions we went towards these field changes can be read about in our ["Pods 2.7: What We Did and Why We Did It"](https://pods.io/2017/12/05/pods-2-7-developer-notes/)
